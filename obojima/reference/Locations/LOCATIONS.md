AMA SHURAK

Home brew town

Makes a special sword called a spirit blade. They have a deal with a demon that he can eat people if he leaves them a heart stone. Which the sword forge uses to fuel their forges and craft the spirit blade. The heart stones power their town and their tech. 

They have signs up in the woods that workers are needed. But it's a scam to draw people in to feed them to the demon. 

The demon is the town elders grandson who has spirit bonded with the demon.
