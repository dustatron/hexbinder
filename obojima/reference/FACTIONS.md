## 1. Mariners' Guild

- **Type:** Undersea explorers guild
- **HQ:** Four lodges at cardinal points (northern & southern active)
- **Leaders:** Captain Clintock (founder), Holly Clintock (north), Paloma Clintock (south)
- **Region:** Island-wide
- **Traits:** Tenacious, Resourceful

### Agents
- **Captain Clintock** — Guild founder. Man of few words but commanding presence. Insatiably curious, driven, introspective. Wears a uniform tailored to match a ship captain from his favorite First Age action figure series. Currently at the southern lodge researching Corruption samples. Loves his daughters more than anything except the sea.
- **Holly Clintock** — Captain's younger daughter. Gifted engineer and shipwright, runs the northern lodge at Pelican's Nest Lighthouse. Optimistic, sense of wonder, prefers workshop work to people. Always has useful tools hanging from her belt, talks to them like old friends. Designed the current Pointue and diving suits. Currently building hull patch for the sub and designing a new ship called the Windward. Lionfish King's #1 target.
- **Paloma Clintock** — Captain's eldest daughter, caretaker of southern lodge. Fearless bordering on reckless. Values lodge members as closer than family. Built her own catamaran the Shrike, wears a magical cloak of mist. Launching solo raids into Lionfish King's domain. Secret: recently infected with Corruption from a fish folk dart — hasn't told anyone.
- **Marcel** — Lighthouse keeper at Pelican's Nest. Broad-shouldered, tall, thick mustache, blind. Navigates using Holly's modified First Age fish finder (sonar rig). Tattooed arms depicting mythical marine life. Accompanied by a pelican spirit named Disaster. Mutual familial bond with Holly though neither admits it.
- **Figby** — Nakudama naturalist, musician, chef, and freediver extraordinaire. Boisterous, quick to laugh. "The glue that keeps the lodge together." Morning dives for fish, cooks meals, plays accordion. Discovered that the spirit Ogo Mo Vogo will transport trusted people to the seafloor. Currently tracking a rare "strobe fish."
- **Leobini** — Ancient navigator, Captain's closest friend. Moves with the help of a crab-like spirit named Mr. Tamlin who carries him on its back. Has a thousand stories about sea monsters, brave sailors, and foolish captains. Lived at the lodge longer than anyone.
- **Dahlia** — Elf apprentice diver. Orphaned (father died on Land of Hot Water excursion, mother died months prior). Bookworm who investigates First Age objects from the Shallows. Owns the island's largest action figure collection. Assisting Captain Clintock with Corruption research.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Apparatus | The Pointue submarine (damaged, in drydock at southern lodge) |
| Specialization | Diving suits, fish finder/sonar tech, deep-water expertise |
| Information | Corruption research samples and underwater survey data |
| Position | Four lodges at compass points give island-wide coastal presence |
| Resources | Salvaged First Age navigation beacons still pulsing with magic |

### Agenda
1. Gather enough Corruption samples from the Shallows to identify the source
2. Convince AHA to share First Age submarine schematics for repair
3. Repair the Pointue's hull and navigation systems
4. Recover the Aquatic Stabilizer from the Lionfish King's Doomspine
5. Launch a deep-water expedition to find the Corruption's origin point

### Obstacles
**Long-term:** The Aquatic Stabilizer — the First Age magic gyroscope critical for deep-current navigation — is mounted on the Lionfish King's flagship Doomspine. Without it, the Pointue can't safely navigate the deep Shallows. Holly is the only engineer who can repair the sub, but she's at the northern lodge while the Pointue sits in drydock at the southern lodge — and the Lionfish King's patrols make transport between them extremely dangerous.

**Immediate:** Paloma Clintock has been secretly infected with the Corruption. A dart from a Venomous Rex raider struck her during a recent solo mission into the Lionfish King's domain. She hasn't told anyone — not her father, not her sister, not the lodge. She's still launching reckless solo raids in her catamaran the Shrike, wearing her cloak of mist. The lodge's AHA researcher is studying Corruption samples just rooms away and could potentially help — but Paloma would have to admit what happened, and Captain Clintock would ground her permanently. Meanwhile the infection is progressing.

### Want
The Aquatic Stabilizer. They'd also accept AHA's help reverse-engineering a replacement, but AHA wants underwater ruin access in return.

Take down the Lionfish king

### Tension
Lionfish King sank the original Pointue and took the Stabilizer. Clintock got the King imprisoned in Uluwa. Decades-long blood feud. Neither will negotiate directly — players make ideal intermediaries.

## 2. The Lionfish King

- **Type:** Underwater kingdom
- **HQ:** Coral Castle in the Shallows
- **Leader:** The Lionfish King
- **Region:** Western Shallows (offshore)
- **Traits:** Grandiose, Vain

### Agents
- **The Lionfish King** — Fish folk. Self-proclaimed monarch of the Western Shallows. Pompous, moody, vain, egotistical — but not a psychopath. Can be reasoned with if skewed in his favor. Rules by bullying and guile, no qualms about breaking his word. Fearful of the Corruption encroaching on his reef. Ultimate goal: marry a descendant of nakudama queen Okumi for true royal status. Bristling mane of spines betrays his mood.
- **Sleethar** — Moray eel royal consigliere and ocean mage. Fears his lord, under constant pressure to crack the Royal Lineages. Cowardly but shrewd and cunning — knows how to placate and manipulate the King. One slip and his head joins the others who toyed too carelessly with the monarch. Could be an ally if approached carefully.
- **Bloodfin the Foul** — Exiled female fish folk captain, leads a pirate band from a sunken First Age town (old Goodie Mart as her lair). Desperately wants back into the King's good graces. Being manipulated by sea hag Slurpgill who wants to turn her into a hag. A wild card — could rejoin the King or defect to Venomous Rex.
- **Borisss** — Sea snake spirit, fiercely loyal to Bloodfin. Coiled around a teddy bear he found when the gang first arrived. Found in Bloodfin's sunken town.
- **Morris** — Giant seahorse spirit. Cowardly, intimidated into serving Bloodfin. Terrified of Slurpgill. Will lie to or tattle on outsiders to survive. Hangs out in Moxy's Music Grotto (sunken First Age music store).
- **Lucinda** — Awakened giant octopus, gentle creature. Bloodfin holds her eggs hostage in a giant clam, forcing Lucinda to act as junkyard dog. Fears both Bloodfin and Slurpgill. A rescue target.
- **Slurpgill** — Sea hag, not technically a subject but a shadow power over Bloodfin's exile band. Wants to build a coven by turning Bloodfin into a hag. All water spirits tremble at her name. Lair location unknown. Designed as a recurring underwater nemesis.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Force | Elite crab sentinels, barracuda warriors, fish folk pirates |
| Apparatus | The Doomspine war barge (with Aquatic Stabilizer in stolen Pointue prow — Stabilizer created by Clintock's late wife Kara) |
| Position | Coral Castle underwater fortress |
| Information | The Royal Lineages — 2 ancient tomes tracking nakudama royal bloodline |
| Resources | The crimson octopus "Boombox" (produces priceless magical ink) |
| Renown | Self-proclaimed king of the Shallows, feared by coastal settlements |

### Agenda
1. Hire surface-dweller mercenaries to assassinate Holly Clintock — she's the only one who can repair the Pointue. Kill the engineer, kill the submarine forever.
2. Decipher the Royal Lineages to identify a living nakudama royal heir
3. Locate the heir and arrange a marriage alliance (willing or not)
4. Hold a coronation ceremony legitimizing his rule in the spirit realm
5. Destroy Captain Clintock and sink whatever's left of his fleet
6. Expand territory from the Shallows into coastal waters

### Obstacles
**Long-term:** The Royal Lineages are written in cryptic nakudama code. His wizard Sleethar has failed to crack it. He needs AHA's translation expertise — but approaching surface-dwellers openly would undermine his authority. Meanwhile, Venomous Rex's corrupted deep-sea fish folk encroach from the east, forcing him to fight on two fronts. Schools of fish folk fleeing "the foul waters" are flooding into his domain, straining resources and making him more territorial and aggressive.

**Immediate:** Bloodfin the Foul — his exiled captain — is being corrupted by the sea hag Slurpgill, who is grooming Bloodfin to become a hag herself and start a coven. Slurpgill is also pushing Bloodfin to defect to Venomous Rex. The Lionfish King doesn't know about Slurpgill's involvement — he thinks Bloodfin is just a disgraced exile raiding the northern coast to win back his favor. If Slurpgill succeeds, the King loses a potential vassal and gains a new enemy on his flank — a hag coven allied with Venomous Rex, operating from a sunken First Age town just miles from the northern divers' lodge.

### Want
A scholar who can decipher the Royal Lineages. Would trade almost anything except the Aquatic Stabilizer (his flagship's heart) or the octopus.

### Tension
Has what Mariners' Guild desperately needs (Stabilizer). Needs what AHA has (translation). Dawn Blossom Guild needs his octopus ink for currency. Venomous Rex's deep-sea raiders pressure him from the east. Some vassals are secretly friendly to Clintock's daughters and open to cooperation against the Corruption. Multiple leverage points for player manipulation.

## 3. Archaeologists, Historians & Archivists (AHA)

- **Type:** Academic guild
- **HQ:** Observatory on a promontory overlooking the ocean, southeastern Coastal Highlands
- **Leaders:** The Asloh — Gurriko (nakudama archaeologist, ancient building techniques), Loninni (human historian, Mount Arbora foothills), Uba (towering blue dara, chief archivist)
- **Region:** Island-wide (dozen+ field sites), HQ in southeastern Coastal Highlands
- **Traits:** Curious, Cautious

### Agents
- **Uba** — Chief Archivist (male blue dara). Stays at HQ overseeing the Archive. Not miserly — happy to share with genuinely interested visitors. Teacher mentality, believes everyone can contribute worthy ideas. Carries a secret shame: once let a charlatan scholar steal a tome detailing Mount Arbora cave networks.
- **Lonzo** — Telescope Operator (male human). Grizzled, grumbly, voice like gravel. Oldest AHA member. Spends time alone at the HQ telescope, nodding off occasionally as he charts stars. A First Age radio he keeps emits white noise interrupted by mysterious snippets in a garbled language he claims are "dispatches about some war."
- **Chloe** — Archaeologist (female elf). Wizard obsessed with First Age technology. Found in her workshop among partially assembled devices, scattered tools, and half a dozen companion spirits. Specialty: cassette players. Avid collector of First Age music — the louder, the better.
- **Vutochi** — Corruption Researcher (cat spirit). Foremost expert on the Corruption. Dispassionate air, appears disengaged or enters trances. Exists in both the Physical Realm and Spirit Realm simultaneously, shifting attention between planes. In the Spirit Realm, transforms into a tall imposing mage. Searches the eastern coastline and Brackwater for fish that escaped skeletonization.
- **Mortimus Fids** — Head Curator of the Yatamon library outpost (male human). About twenty AHA members work at this First Age library. Mortimus rules with self-importance and snobbery that makes everyone loathe him. Will make adventurers grovel, ego-stroke, and jump through hoops before sharing information.
- **Dr. Zalia Frond** — Archaeologist (female human). Leads the ongoing underground excavation beneath Yatamon's undercity. Affable, enthusiastic. Partnered with Krocius.
- **Krocius** — Claimed Second Age scholar (male nakudama). Reserved, soft-spoken, lets Dr. Frond do the talking. Secretly using Frond and AHA to delve into dangerous areas searching for the lost prison of ancient nakudama emperor Oghmai.
- **Isabel Skiff** — Field researcher (female human). High-society AHA member stationed at Toggle. Hunting for a rare gemstone called a dragon's fist. Well-funded, dapper clothes, sticks out among miners — but earnest about rolling up her sleeves.
- **Dini** — Field researcher (nakudama). Leads expeditions to Shoom, an abandoned Nakudama Age site.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Information | Largest First Age tech archive — computers, floppy disks, arcade cabinets (Detective Werewolf Saga), radios, VHS tapes, cassette players |
| Specialization | Translation expertise for First Age languages and codes; deciphered much of First Age language |
| Members | Field research teams at dozen+ excavation sites; ~20 staff at Yatamon library outpost; chronicler spirits (dozen robed spirits that take dictation on scroll strips) |
| Position | 19-level observatory HQ with telescope, labs, archive, curio museum; Yatamon library outpost (First Age library) |
| Resources | First Age canned food stockpile, preserved artifacts, refurbished telescope tracking stars and flying beasts |
| Vulnerability | Flooded lowest levels secretly occupied by corrupted viperfish folk loyal to Venomous Rex, seeking entry into HQ |

### Agenda
1. Explore the ancient subway tunnels beneath Yatamon — Dr. Frond's dig is pushing deeper into the undercity, mapping collapsed passages and First Age infrastructure
2. Discover where the Wandering Line goes and what its depot network connects to — the subway system may have once linked terminals across the island
3. Research the Corruption — housing infected rangers in HQ labs, studying skeletonized fish in aquariums, losing researchers to exposure. Theories: it may be seeping into groundwater, may respond as one organism, may be hunting the island's spirit life force
4. Investigate the stellar anomaly — constellations have shifted, star movements are slowing. Debate: are the sky spirits calming, or has the island itself stopped drifting?
5. Gain access to underwater ruins via Mariners' Guild submarine
6. Decode Lonzo's mysterious radio "war dispatches" — who is broadcasting?
7. Find the Disappearing Mountain — appeared on the northeast horizon, traveled south for two days, then vanished. Expedition sent to find it never returned. Still obsesses a small group of members.

### Obstacles
**Long-term:** Spread too thin. Field researchers are falling ill from Corruption exposure. The most critical underwater ruins require the Mariners' Guild submarine, but the Guild demands Corruption research help first. The Yatamon subway dig keeps hitting collapsed tunnels and dangerous creatures. Resources pulled in every direction.

**Immediate:** The flooded lowest levels of AHA headquarters — sealed off and forgotten long ago — have been discovered and occupied by corrupted viperfish folk loyal to Venomous Rex. They're actively looking for a way into the upper floors. AHA has no idea they're down there. If they breach the labs housing Corruption-infected rangers and skeletonized fish specimens, the consequences could be catastrophic — both for the researchers and for the volatile specimens getting loose.

### Want
Underwater First Age ruin access (Mariners' Guild has it). The Royal Lineages (Lionfish King has them) — could trade translation services but that would legitimize a tyrant. Safe passage through subway tunnels. Answers about the Wandering Line depot network.

### Tension
Natural partnership with Mariners' Guild but competing priorities. Could be kingmaker in the Lionfish King conflict — whoever they help wins. Phin was once AHA, wants to keep airfield tech to himself. Lom & Salt want metallurgy manuals from the archive. Krocius is secretly using Frond's dig to hunt for the Prison of Oghmai — AHA doesn't know their own researcher has a hidden agenda. Viperfish folk have infiltrated the flooded HQ basement.

---

## 4. Fish Head Coven

- **Type:** Most powerful witch coven
- **HQ:** Witching Tower — three brick towers connected by bridges in the Gale Fields. Domain surrounded by magical hedgerow that alerts the Council when crossed, with gatehouses at four cardinal directions (each garrisoned by a trio of witches).
- **Leaders:** Council of Three and Thirty (3 witches + The Thirty, an amalgamated spirit entity)
- **Region:** Gale Fields (HQ), island-wide influence. Dozens of affiliated witches across the island.
- **Traits:** Domineering, Secretive

### Agents
- **Yolikanter Crogiss** — Council Witch (female nakudama). Paranoid, specializes in warding magic. "It's easier to catch a wandering door than it is to catch Yolikanter by surprise." Almost always present at the Witches' Bridge.
- **Bim of the Beasts** — Council Witch (female human, unknown age). Enigmatic. Speaks ONLY through animals — never uses her own voice. Almost always at the Witches' Bridge.
- **Brass Eyes** — Council Witch (male human, tiny, withered). Eyes replaced with brass orbs. Said to live simultaneously in both Physical and Spirit Realm. No living witch knows his real name. Often unclear if he's talking to you or to unseen spirits.
- **Tan the Apprentice & Abi** — Newcomer (13-year-old human boy). Apprentices for renowned Witch Ognev. Awkward kid who appears to talk to himself — actually speaking to invisible spirit companion Abi, who is very protective. Learning to be a spirit medium. Sneaks out at night to explore the grounds, has a trinket stash at a serpent standing stone.
- **Ognev** — Renowned Witch (male). Tan's master. Recognized Tan's gift when everyone else thought he was just a weird kid.
- **Ermy Flower** — Coven Witch, runs ingredient kiosk cart below the Witching Tower's lowest bridge. Personable, chatty, loves talking about the best places to eat on the island. Has three magpies: Licorice, Sugar, and Molasses.
- **Alkun** — Resident Witch. Has connections to elder spirit Sorolu (made of earth and vines) — would seek help healing it from unknown malady.
- **Unnamed retired Witch** — Former Council of Three and Thirty member, once one of the most powerful and politically influential Fish Head witches. Retired years ago to Okiri village, now runs a repair shop using transmutation magic. Locals don't know she's a witch. Accepts odd payment ("a piece of blue glass and a turnip — and the glass had better be blue!").
- **The Lady & The Mighty Peapaleap** — Two resident companion spirits (cats). The Lady is highly sociable. Peapaleap is a fat fluffy long-haired cat who rides a floating square cushion. They wander the grounds together, sometimes following interesting visitors.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Magic | 2 of 7 Almanac volumes (Gale Fields & Shallows), cassette tape spell scrolls |
| Apparatus | First Age cassette players repurposed as spellcasting foci |
| Subterfuge | Dozens of affiliated witches embedded in settlements across island; chot-to spy statues in the Sanctum that secretly record conversations and report to the Council |
| Position | The Closed Fists (twin vaults): Northern = bulk ingredient stores guarded by urugama demons bound to wall masks. Southern = most dangerous magic items, protected by silver-chained mushroom cages (paralyzing spore cloud, DC 20 Con, 3 days). |
| Information | The Sanctum — secret underground cavern beneath the central tower. Hundreds of chot-to statues (spirit-inhabited figurines), each storing a spell, event, or ingredient recipe. Witches summon them with a keystone. |
| Renown | Most powerful coven — others defer or resent them. Help run the Witchery academy in Yatamon (First Age movie theater) where all covens train new witches. Neutral ground managed by Warlock Mr. Basingstoke and his silent octopus spirit Sorrow. |

### Agenda
1. Locate the covens holding the remaining 5 Almanac volumes (7 total, one per region — Fish Head has 2, every other major coven has 1)
2. Acquire volumes through trade, trickery, or intimidation — starting with Cloud Cap's
3. Obtain Spirit Coal from the Wandering Line's caboose for master recipes
4. Achieve total monopoly over magical ingredient knowledge on Obojima
5. Discover what the Crawling Canopy is hiding — the Council of Kroo's territorial secrecy intrigues them

### Obstacles
**Long-term:** Every rival coven guards their Almanac volume with their lives. Direct theft risks open coven war. The Council must acquire them without uniting the other covens against them. The Crawling Canopy keeps evading their scouting parties.

**Immediate:** Sorolu — an elder spirit made of earth and vines that dwells in the Gale Fields — is suffering from an unknown malady. Sorolu has been a silent guardian of the domain for generations, and its decline is weakening the land magic the coven draws on. Alkun can't diagnose or cure it alone and needs rare ingredients and outside help. The Council has been ignoring the Corruption as someone else's problem, but Sorolu's sickness may be the first sign it's already seeping into their territory. If Sorolu dies or turns demon, the Fish Head domain loses its spiritual anchor — and the hedgerow wards may fail with it.

### Want
The 5 remaining Almanac volumes (one per rival coven). Spirit Coal from the Wandering Line. Access to the Crawling Canopy's secrets. Will trade cassette spell scrolls, ingredient knowledge, or favors — but never their own volumes.

### Tension
Every coven interaction is colored by this rivalry. Goro Goros' Mikiko is secretly a Fish Head apprentice — if discovered, the coven may punish her and crush the gang. Council of Kroo keeps moving the Crawling Canopy to evade Fish Head scouts. Tellu & Scale's nomadic school needs passage through Gale Fields — Fish Head sees their nakudama heritage claim to Lilywin as a territorial threat. Dawn Blossom needs their ingredients for currency. A retired former Council member hides in plain sight in Okiri.

---

## 5. Courier Brigade

- **Type:** Postal knights order
- **HQ:** First Age bank in Yatamon (vault used for package storage). The Flying Lantern (famous hot air balloon) is moored on the roof — a major city attraction. Training ground on-site for riding, running, and lantern piloting. Also maintains Fort Harglo (crossroads fort in the Gale Fields, used for ceremonies) and brigade halls in most towns.
- **Leaders:** Postmaster General Miranda Escalante (female human, Yatamon)
- **Region:** Island-wide — parcel boxes in most settlements, all designed to look like fish mouths (honoring the river spirit Din, where the very first postal box was established at Opal Falls)
- **Traits:** Dutiful, Stubborn

### Agents
- **Postmaster General Miranda Escalante** — Female human. Oversees training of every knight in the brigade. Makes sure recruits understand and respect their oath to the postal corps. Honest, forthcoming, tries to help those around her. Personally leads an elite squad dispatched to relieve imperiled couriers. Quotes: "A letter isn't just a piece of paper... these things bind the island, they connect us."
- **Gomber and Beeks** — Private eyes (male human and paunchy bird spirit). Hard-boiled, straight-shooting detective duo. Beeks pretty much just says "Beek!" but Gomber understands him completely. Officially part of the Brigade — track down mail fraud, apprehend package thieves, and thwart skullduggery within Yatamon city limits.
- **Wayla** — River Master at Opal Falls (female elf). Oversees boat traffic and toll collection. Runs two gangs of dockworkers operating water-powered elevators. Also a Brigade member — proudly tells everyone that the very first postal box was established at the falls, made in honor of the river spirit Din.
- **Lomi** — 13-year-old boy, younger brother of Ashi (a Courier Brigade knight). Dreams of being a postal knight. Eager but accident-prone — delivered a letter to the wrong address and is desperate to fix it before his sister finds out.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Position | Fort Harglo (Gale Fields crossroads fort), Yatamon bank HQ, brigade halls and outposts in most towns. Maintains the major roads that crisscross the Gale Fields. |
| Force | Elite postal knights (rapid-response squad led by Escalante), trained bird mounts (large flightless birds preferred). Every knight has a home anywhere on the island — knock and food/shelter are theirs. |
| Apparatus | First Age bank vault (package storage), the Flying Lantern (hot air balloon, powered by pink enchanted candles), Toggle minecarts and water flume for mountain delivery |
| Specialization | Waxworks Division — founded by Lydia Starwright, the first Waxwork Rogue, who learned arcane wax/fire enchantments from a witch in the Land of Hot Water. Dedicated arcane rogues for the most perilous deliveries. Now practiced island-wide. |
| Information | Island-wide postal network — couriers see and hear everything. Fish-mouth postal boxes in every settlement. Gomber & Beeks handle intelligence/fraud. |
| Beliefs | "Deliverance Through Delivery" — unshakeable institutional creed. Sworn in through ceremonial oath. |

### Agenda
1. Map safe routes through eastern corrupted territory using Ranger intel
2. Acquire working First Age vehicles for faster dangerous-zone delivery
3. Establish a fortified relay station in the Brackwater Wetlands
4. Restore full delivery service to Polewater and eastern settlements
5. Earn formal recognition as Obojima's civil defense force (not just mail carriers)

### Obstacles
**Long-term:** The Rangers of the Greenward Path have the territory maps and safe-passage knowledge the Brigade needs, but the Rangers are overwhelmed and infected — sharing intel means publicly admitting the eastern front is collapsing. The established paths through the Brackwater Wetlands were washed away by the tsunami, and cross-country travel has proven too dangerous.

**Immediate:** Imelda, a package thief in Yatamon, uses her floating fur-covered spirit companion Choofi (who can identify any object by smell alone) to raid unattended Brigade wagons for valuables. Gomber and Beeks are on her trail, but she keeps evading them. Every stolen package undermines public trust in the Brigade's sacred oath.

### Want
Rangers' Corruption territory maps and safe-passage routes. Working First Age vehicles (motorcycles, kei trucks). Toraf & Boulder's combat-experienced students as route escorts. A way to reopen communication with Polewater.

### Tension
Loosely allied with Rangers but strained by pride on both sides. Fort Harglo sits in Fish Head Coven territory — requires a delicate non-aggression arrangement. Roads they maintain in the Gale Fields may trace the streets of ancient Lilywin — Tellu & Scale's territorial claim could complicate their road maintenance. Sea routes to the east have become impassable due to increased Corruption in the Shallows.

---

## 6. Cloud Cap Coven

- **Type:** Mountain witch coven
- **HQ:** Mount Arbora (exact location secret — said to have originated from a mountaintop village of a bygone era where the tradition of "hunting for lightning" was common practice)
- **Leaders:** Unknown (coven leadership kept secret)
- **Region:** Mount Arbora
- **Traits:** Vigilant, Reclusive

### Agents
- **Nuharo / "Grimcloak"** — 14-year-old human girl apprenticing with the Cloud Cap Coven. Disguises herself as "Grimcloak," an old male wizard with a short wild black beard and faded blue eyepatch. Runs a small arcana and curio shop in the cellar of Murgin's Tavern and Inn in the Graysteps. Established a reputation for reversing curses and hexes, particularly spirit-related ones. Speaks in hushed tones, sentences trail off. Entrepreneurial spirit led her to set up shop on her own — no one in the Graysteps knows her true identity. The only thing she and Grimcloak share is the eyepatch. Hates walking on stilts (common in the Graysteps) but has gotten quite good at it. Uses the Witch stat block.
- **Sessra** — [NOT FROM SOURCE] Coven elder (female elf, ancient). Cloud Cap's senior weather-reader and keeper of the lightning rites. Lives at the coven's hidden high-altitude HQ where she monitors storm patterns and spirit migrations across the mountain. Rarely descends below the snowline. Communicates with lower-altitude members via a trained pair of storm hawks that carry knotted cord messages. Deeply suspicious of Lom & Salt's forge smoke drifting into sacred thermals. Nuharo's mentor — proud of the girl's initiative but worried she's too exposed in the Graysteps.
- **Kettro** — [NOT FROM SOURCE] Trail warden (male nakudama). Patrols the mountain paths between the Graysteps, Toggle, and the upper slopes. Poses as a wandering mushroom forager selling rare high-altitude fungi to travelers — actually mapping who comes and goes on the mountain and why. Stocky, quiet, carries a walking staff carved with Cloud Cap ward-glyphs that hum faintly near corrupted ground. Recently noticed Lom & Salt students venturing further from the school grounds than usual, prospecting for new geothermal vents. Reports to Sessra.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Magic | 1 Almanac volume (Mount Arbora region) — one of Granny Prumple's seven volumes, jealously guarded |
| Specialization | Rare high-altitude herbs and fungi found nowhere else on the island; lightning-hunting tradition |
| Information | Deep knowledge of Mount Arbora's spirit pathways, sacred sites, and massive creatures that roam its slopes |
| Position | Hidden mountain HQ in Obojima's most treacherous terrain — thick mists, crags, titanic creatures deter intruders |
| Subterfuge | Nuharo embedded in the Graysteps as "Grimcloak," gathering intelligence from mountain travelers and spirit-troubled visitors |

### Agenda
1. Protect Mount Arbora's sacred spirit sanctuaries from encroachment — Lom & Salt's forge expansion near the summit is pushing into sacred ground
2. Resist Fish Head Coven's escalating pressure to surrender their Almanac volume — every major coven wants what they don't have
3. Monitor the Sky King's domain high on the mountain and the aeronaut craze from Sky Kite Valley — Rock Raley's teams are building flying machines to ascend to the peak, which could disturb sacred sites and the great beast
4. Assess whether the Corruption threatens Mount Arbora — the mountain's rivers feed the whole island, and contaminated meltwater could spread devastation everywhere
5. Maintain Nuharo's cover in the Graysteps and expand intelligence gathering across mountain settlements

### Obstacles
**Long-term:** Squeezed from all sides. Fish Head Coven constantly pressures for the Almanac volume and has the political weight to escalate. Lom & Salt's forge on the upper slopes needs geothermal vents that cut through spirit sanctuaries — and the school's ancient prestige makes it hard to oppose openly. AHA wants access to mountain sacred sites for research. Rock Raley's expedition to the Sky King threatens to bring swarms of outsiders into territory the coven has kept private for generations. Every faction wants something from Mount Arbora.

**Immediate:** In the Graysteps, village elder Phent has a secret chamber in his cellar where he keeps a Corruption-tainted spirit captive. He's deliberately prodding it toward madness, and once it fully transforms into a demon, he plans to release it in the town of Toggle to foment fear and paranoia about spirits. Nuharo is operating her shop in the same village — in the cellar of the tavern next door — and has no idea. If Phent's demon escapes prematurely or if his scheme is exposed violently, Nuharo could be caught in the crossfire, and her cover as Grimcloak could unravel. Worse, an unleashed demon on Mount Arbora would be blamed on spirit activity — exactly the kind of crisis that could justify outsiders demanding access to Cloud Cap's sacred sites.

### Want
Fish Head Coven to stop pressuring for the Almanac volume. Lom & Salt to respect spirit sanctuary boundaries. Outsiders to stay away from the Sky King's domain. Intelligence about the Corruption's potential spread to mountain waterways.

### Tension
Fish Head Coven's pressure for the Almanac is relentless — they already have two volumes and want all seven. Lom & Salt operates in Cloud Cap territory and trades sacred Guardian Sphere fragments to AHA, which Cloud Cap considers profane. The Deep Current seeks mountain access for reasons Cloud Cap doesn't understand — they unknowingly guard the approaches to Oghmai's prison inside Mount Arbora. Rock Raley's Sky King expedition could bring chaos to the peak. The Graysteps' anti-spirit culture makes it a hostile operating environment for Nuharo, and Phent's secret demon scheme is a ticking bomb.

## 7. Rangers of the Greenward Path

- **Type:** Ranger organization
- **Base:** Brackwater Wetlands (no fixed HQ — operate from outposts, camps, and allied locations across eastern Obojima)
- **Region:** Eastern Obojima (Brackwater Wetlands, Shade Wood, eastern coastline)
- **Traits:** Grim, Loyal

### Agents
- **Stout Crumm** — Former Ranger (female elf). Short, stocky, and silent. Rumored to have been among the first Rangers to encounter the Corruption. Now a fixture at Murgin's Tavern in the Graysteps, where she communicates only by scrawling on a slate with chalk — won't speak beyond the occasional grunt or snort. An accomplished warrior who can be challenged for a sword school signet. Only talks about the Corruption to people who buy her a drink. What she saw broke something in her.
- **Tetsuri** — Corrupted Ranger (male human). Was infected during the initial Corruption incursion and fled his village to avoid spreading it. Weakened and desperate, he made a deal with Venomous Rex — stonefish venom to slow the Corruption in exchange for service. Now hooked on the venom and acting as Rex's underling. Currently hiding in Toggle under a new identity, waiting for Holly Clintock to arrive so he can kidnap her and deliver her to Venomous Rex. Will befriend adventurers if he hears them mention Holly, the Pointue, or Duro's golem — then betray them when the time is right.
- **Poli** — Grove Keeper (female dara). Ranger stationed at Roa Kala, the sacred dara forest. Records new glyphs found within the forest and protects glyph trees from howlers who chop them down for firewood. Spends almost all her time outdoors patrolling — the trees stretch for miles. Well-liked by the dara but less than friendly to outsiders after a lifetime of running woodcutters and bandits out of the forest.
- **Master Boulder** — Former Ranger, now co-master of Toraf & Boulder's sword school (male human). Credits years as a Ranger of the Greenward Path for his fighting skill. Still driven by his ranger's oath to keep the Brackwater safe. Consummate survivalist — lives beyond the school in a wilderness camp. Speaks in a low voice, moves in a semi-crouch as though always about to pounce. "It's good to be scared — fear is the ultimate catalyst for action."
- **Unnamed Ranger at Shade Wood camp** — A ranger suffering advanced Corruption who, alongside a local druid, has been single-handedly defending a refugee camp in the Shade Wood for over a month. Using the last vestiges of her strength to keep the camp safe from skeletonized howlers that pick off the weak at night. Believes it's only a matter of time before the woods overrun the camp.
- **Rangers at AHA HQ** — Several rangers among the first to respond to the Corruption now live in AHA's laboratory units under constant care and observation. Researchers monitor them for signs of change but have found no cure or way to slow the spread.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Information | Detailed maps of Corruption spread, firsthand knowledge of corrupted territory survival |
| Specialization | Vaulter's Axe — signature ranger tool designed for Brackwater exploration (tall haft for checking water depth and vaulting obstacles). Field expertise in tracking and fighting Wetlands monsters |
| Alliances | Military alliance with Toraf & Boulder's sword school (Master Boulder is a former Ranger). Attempting supply runs to Polewater. Crowsworn coven is their closest magical ally |
| Resources | Field samples of corrupted flora and fauna. Rangers embedded at AHA labs providing live Corruption data |
| Conviction | Will not abandon the eastern front regardless of cost |

### Agenda
1. Compare land Corruption samples with Mariners' Guild underwater samples
2. Identify common origin point or vulnerability in the Corruption
3. Develop a field-deployable countermeasure (working with Crowsworn potions)
4. Get relief supplies through to Polewater — roads destroyed by tsunami, cross-country travel too dangerous, marauders in the Wetlands
5. Cure infected rangers before the disease becomes irreversible
6. Push the Corruption boundary back from populated areas

### Obstacles
**Long-term:** The Rangers are losing. Many are already infected — publicly admitting the true casualty count could cause island-wide panic and withdrawal of support. The Mariners' Guild has underwater Corruption samples they need but demands Corruption territory escorts in return — sending infected rangers underwater risks spreading it. Spread impossibly thin: defending refugee camps in the Shade Wood, attempting supply runs to cut-off Polewater, providing live research data at AHA labs, and holding the Corruption boundary — all with dwindling healthy numbers.

**Immediate:** Tetsuri, one of their own, has turned. A corrupted Ranger hiding in Toggle under a false identity, hooked on Venomous Rex's stonefish venom, waiting to kidnap Holly Clintock — the one engineer who can repair the Pointue submarine that the entire island's Corruption research depends on. The Rangers don't know they have a traitor. If Tetsuri succeeds, the Mariners' Guild loses Holly, the Pointue stays broken, the underwater expedition never launches, and the Corruption's source stays hidden. One compromised Ranger could unravel the whole fight.

### Want
Mariners' Guild underwater Corruption samples. Courier Brigade reinforcements and supply route escorts. Crowsworn's experimental Corruption-resistance potions. Healthy replacements — they're running out of people.

### Tension
Most urgent faction — they're losing. Alliance with Toraf & Boulder is strong but both are exhausted. Crowsworn coven is their best magical ally but demands an Almanac volume trade with Fish Head as payment. Master Boulder at Toraf & Boulder's school still holds his ranger's oath sacred — a bridge between the factions. Stout Crumm in the Graysteps carries intelligence about the early Corruption encounters that she won't share easily. Tetsuri's betrayal, once discovered, will shake the Rangers' trust in their own.

## 8. Lom & Salt's College of Arms

- **Type:** Oldest sword school
- **HQ:** Cut into the mountainside on the upper reaches of Mount Arbora — the most remote of the island's sword schools. Those who make the ascent have "taken the first step toward tempering the body and honing the will."
- **Leaders:** Master Lom, Master Salt
- **Region:** Mount Arbora
- **Traits:** Traditional, Proud

### Agents
- **Master Lom** — Co-master (female human). Rough but friendly manner, sarcastic humor. Lovingly calls new students "ingots" — a nod to the potential in everyone to become something greater. Known to take students with troubled pasts under her wing. Before dedicating herself to swordcraft, Lom had an unsavory past as part of a bandit company raiding Mount Arbora's foothills. Heard about a cache of prized swords at the College, led a raid to steal them — and was awed when Master Salt fought off the entire attack alone. Surrendered, pleaded to learn. Salt dismissed her. It took Lom years of making amends before she was accepted as Salt's disciple. Proved a talented warrior and smith. Together with Salt for six years.
- **Master Salt** — Co-master (female elf). Grim-faced, born at the school among the din of hammers. Even as a child her forging skill was recognized. Tireless before the forge — when she starts a project, she dons her headphones and works to synth-pop. Legendary endurance as a duelist, prefers to win by outlasting opponents. Speaks rarely, usually in whispers. "Things will get hard. Endurance allows us to act without rashness — the source of all mistakes." Senior master, mentored Lom. In the absence of students, the pair communicate entirely through an ad hoc sign language they developed over the years.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Apparatus | Ancient forge heated by Mount Arbora's geothermal vents; secret sanctum forge where worthy students forge their own blade under both masters' tutelage (two-week process) |
| Specialization | Swordsmanship AND swordsmithing tradition dating to the early Nakudama Age (Second Age). Metal selection system: cobalt (spirit detection), copper (lightning resistance), lead (magic nullification), nickel (spellcasting focus), tungsten (object destruction), zinc (animal mastery). Blades coveted across the island — the masters of every other school wield Lom & Salt blades |
| Renown | Oldest martial institution on Obojima. Every sword school master on the island carries one of their blades. Tellu & Scale each wield a blade forged by the other during their time here |
| Position | Most remote school — the ascent itself serves as the first test. Cut into the mountainside near the summit |
| Beliefs | Four virtues: "I drew my blade in defense." "I drew my blade to help another." "I kept a sword from an unworthy hand." "I did not draw my blade." Philosophy: "A sword is a thing of terrible potential." |

### Agenda
1. Obtain First Age metallurgy manuals from AHA (airplane maintenance docs detail alloy compositions)
2. Acquire Spirit Coal from the Wandering Line's caboose to fuel the forge to temperatures needed for new alloys
3. Successfully combine First Age alloys with traditional blade techniques and the glyph-folding methods pioneered by Duro and Garo in Toggle
4. Forge a legendary blade worthy of the school's ancient reputation
5. Present the blade at a grand tournament, re-establishing dominance over rival schools

### Obstacles
**Long-term:** The metallurgy manuals are split between AHA's archive and Broken Bird Airfield. AHA wants access to the mountain's sacred sites or rare artifacts in return — but operating in Cloud Cap Coven's territory means any trade that invites outsiders up the mountain risks coven retaliation. Spirit Coal requires entering the Wandering Line's caboose and striking a deal with the Coal Master — a trial few have survived. The school's remote position, once its greatest strength, now isolates it from the alliances forming across the island.

**Immediate:** Lom's past is catching up. Air pirates have established a stronghold on the western slope of Mount Arbora, raiding settlements in the foothills — the same territory where Lom once operated as a bandit. Some of the pirates are former associates who know exactly who she was. If word spreads that one of the island's most respected swordmasters was once a raider, it could undermine the school's moral authority — the very foundation of their philosophy that only the worthy should wield their blades. Lom hasn't told Salt how close the pirates are, or that she recognizes faces among them.

### Want
First Age metallurgy manuals (AHA has them). Spirit Coal (Wandering Line caboose — requires dealing with the Coal Master). Collaboration with Toggle's forgemasters Duro and Garo on glyph-folding techniques. Cloud Cap Coven to acknowledge the school's ancient claim to its mountain position.

### Tension
Operating in Cloud Cap Coven's territory — any forge expansion risks sacred ground. Cloud Cap would oppose outsiders (AHA, researchers) being invited up the mountain for trades. Canden & Moon's political ambitions threaten their "oldest school" prestige — but Canden & Moon's students lack the character Lom & Salt demand. Toraf & Boulder respects them but is too consumed by the Corruption front to engage. Tellu & Scale trained here and carry their blades — a connection that could be leveraged or exploited.

---

## 9. Canden & Moon's School

- **Type:** Largest sword school
- **HQ:** Ornate hexagonal structure built with a First Age aesthetic — takes up an entire city block in the heart of Yatamon, once a First Age boarding school. Manicured garden doubles as training ground. Attached dormitory for students.
- **Leaders:** Master Canden, Master Moon
- **Region:** Gift of Shuritashi (Yatamon)
- **Traits:** Disciplined, Influential

### Agents
- **Master Canden** — Co-master (male human). Full name Carmine Canden. Stern face and measured speech that intimidates new students — but in truth an exceedingly patient teacher who sees the best in his pupils. Not a coddler: mastery comes with work and dedication. Teaches that skill without purpose is meaningless — service to others is core curriculum. Found most mornings at dawn practicing forms beneath his beloved maple tree in the garden courtyard. Utterly devoted to the school, which he considers his greatest accomplishment.
- **Master Moon** — Co-master (female human). The embodiment of elegance — her presence is imposing, her movements so majestic she appears otherworldly at times. Grace and precision with a sword likely unrivaled on the island — even Canden believes hers to be the most technically competent hands he's ever seen. Quick to laugh, passion for reading and reciting humorous poetry. Selects students for monster-slaying missions when threats range close to Yatamon.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Members | Largest student body on the island — so popular that most Obojimans have "at least spent a summer" here. Students bolster the city watch and escort AHA researchers into subway tunnels |
| Position | Prime hexagonal structure in Yatamon's heart. Training ground, dormitory, community service hub |
| Renown | Masters have no political ambitions but wield tremendous political influence — their reputation for wisdom and producing fine warriors makes their counsel highly sought after. Universally well-regarded, unblemished by controversy |
| Specialization | Master technique "The Inscrutable Sword" — emphasizes swiftness and keeping the opponent unsure whether one is attacking or defending. Dance-like movements allow strikes from any direction or turning aside unblockable attacks |
| Beliefs | Motto: "Right conduct and proper form in every situation." Four acts of service required before students may challenge the masters: guard duty (city watch), judging contests, monster threats, escorting AHA researchers into subway tunnels |

### Agenda
1. Address the Goro Goros problem — their magical graffiti defaces the school and mocks the institution publicly
2. Demonstrate the school's value through expanded community service — monster patrols, city watch, subway escorts
3. Win a decisive public tournament victory over a rival school to reaffirm their standing
4. Ensure the school's integrity remains unblemished as the island's security situation deteriorates
5. Fulfill Master Canden's vision: every student who leaves this school should serve Obojima, not just themselves

### Obstacles
**Long-term:** The school's greatest strength — its spotless reputation — is also its greatest vulnerability. The Goro Goros' magical graffiti openly mocks them and resists removal, making the institution look powerless. A violent crackdown would destroy the school's image of disciplined restraint. Meanwhile, Toraf & Boulder and the Rangers are fighting and dying in the east — Canden & Moon's students have numbers but lack real combat experience. Sending untrained students to the front could be a massacre. Doing nothing looks cowardly. The masters' refusal to play politics means other factions use their influence without their consent.

**Immediate:** Students escorting AHA researchers into the subway tunnels beneath Yatamon are encountering increasingly dangerous conditions as Dr. Frond's dig pushes deeper into the undercity. Collapsed passages, hostile spirits, and creatures that dwell in the tunnels have injured several students. Master Moon has been personally assessing the threats, but the deeper excavations — steered by Krocius toward passages the school knows nothing about — are opening areas that no one has entered in centuries. A student going missing or being killed in the tunnels would force the masters to cut off AHA's escort arrangement, crippling Frond's dig and exposing a rift between two of Yatamon's most important institutions.

### Want
The Goro Goros to stop defacing the school. A rival school willing to accept a formal tournament challenge. Recognition of the school's community service record — not political endorsement, but acknowledgment that their students serve Obojima. Safe passage through the subway tunnels for their students escorting AHA.

### Tension
Goro Goros' Mikiko is secretly a budding witch making pigment potions for the gang's magic ink — she's also a Young Steward who feels bad about the vandalism but wants to fit in and thinks Tatsu is "totally cool." If Fish Head Coven discovers she's using potion-brewing knowledge for graffiti, it could escalate far beyond a street gang problem. Toraf & Boulder views the school as privileged and untested while real fighters die. Lom & Salt respects the masters' skill but considers the school's emphasis on form over substance misguided. The subway escort missions quietly make them AHA's most important local ally in Yatamon — a relationship neither institution has formalized but both depend on.

---

## 10. Toraf & Boulder's School

- **Type:** Practical combat sword school
- **Full Name:** Toraf & Boulder's School of Guts & Grit
- **HQ:** A squat, square tower built of stone on the southernmost point of the Pale Hills, overlooking the Brackwater Wetlands. Once a hunting lodge in the days of the nakudama monarchy. Field training over drills — even the greenest students are expected on expeditions.
- **Leaders:** Master Toraf, Master Boulder
- **Region:** Brackwater Wetlands / Pale Hills
- **Traits:** Battle-Hardened, Blunt

### Agents
- **Master Toraf** — Co-master (male human). Barking way of speaking — possesses but one volume: loud. Enormous frame clad in onyx black armor and helm — looks like a monster from the Wetlands. Not the nurturing sort: his bellows boom through the school as he rips students' technique to shreds. Calls students who demonstrate "a special kind of stupid" his "hangnails." Lives at the school. Has learned at every sword school on the island and remains convinced the other masters are too content with the theory of fighting. Previously worked as armed escort for merchants, earning the nickname "The Door" for filling doorways entirely with his bulk. Students under his tutelage live at the school and accompany him into the Wetlands to aid wayward travelers.
- **Master Boulder** — Co-master (male human). Consummate survivalist. Lives outside the school in a nearby wilderness camp. Credits years as a Ranger of the Greenward Path for his fighting skill — still driven by his ranger's oath to keep the region safe. Restless manner, moving in a semi-crouch as though always a moment from pouncing on a foe just out of sight. Speaks in a low voice that forces students to lean in to hear him. In rare still moments, hones his sword edge with a whetstone. "It's good to be scared — fear is the ultimate catalyst for action." His students camp in the wilderness and are led on expeditions to track the most dangerous monsters in the Wetlands.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Force | Battle-hardened students with real combat experience against Wetlands monsters and Corruption. Only school where field training IS the curriculum |
| Alliances | Military alliance with Rangers of the Greenward Path — Master Boulder is a former Ranger and still holds his oath. Both factions operate in the same territory |
| Specialization | Master technique "Grim Skill Set" aka "The Striking Snake" — three strikes from the same guard position, obscuring the target (head, torso, or leg) until the last moment. Developed specifically to counter Brackwater monsters. Students master it by fighting those monsters |
| Conviction | Will not retreat from the eastern front. The previous masters died of a Wetlands sickness and summoned Toraf and Boulder as successors — they carry that weight |
| Position | Stone tower on the Pale Hills gives high ground overlooking the Wetlands — natural watchtower and defensible position |

### Agenda
1. Hold the Brackwater against the Corruption's westward spread — patrol, protect refugees, fight corrupted creatures
2. Send student expeditions to Polewater to help rebuild after the tsunami — encountering Corruption, refugees, and Courier Brigade trouble en route
3. Train enough students to rotate front-line shifts without burning out
4. Secure uncorrupted fresh water — the Wetlands are being poisoned
5. Get reinforcements from anywhere — Courier Brigade, Canden & Moon, anyone willing to fight

### Obstacles
**Long-term:** Asking for help means admitting the east is losing. Canden & Moon has the numbers but their students lack real combat experience — sending them to the Wetlands unprepared could be a massacre. The Rangers are their closest allies but both are exhausted and depleted. The previous masters died of a Wetlands sickness — a grim precedent as the Corruption poisons the same territory. The masters are NOT friends: bound only by mutual contempt for the other schools. Their sparring demonstrations inevitably escalate to real blows. If one falls to the Corruption or exhaustion, the other won't carry the school alone out of loyalty — he'll do it out of spite, and that's a thin thread.

**Immediate:** A traveler has collapsed on the school steps, managing only to whisper "Hakumon's" before falling unconscious. Vespoma — creatures with enchanting speech — have overrun Hakumon's Ramen Shop in the Wetlands, tormenting patrons. Master Toraf has assembled students for a rescue mission. Meanwhile, a student expedition sent to Polewater hasn't reported back on schedule — the route through the Wetlands has become more treacherous as Corruption-warped creatures stalk the paths. Boulder wants to go after the missing students personally, but leaving the school undefended means trusting Toraf alone with every remaining student. Neither master trusts the other that far.

### Want
Courier Brigade soldiers. Canden & Moon students (trained up fast). Clean water source. Crowsworn's experimental Corruption-resistance potions. Their missing student expedition returned safely.

### Tension
Most militarily exposed faction. Respects Rangers deeply — Boulder still holds his ranger's oath — but both are running on fumes. Contempt for Canden & Moon's privileged, untested students, though they'd take any warm body willing to fight. Would accept help from any faction, no questions asked. The masters' volatile relationship is held together by necessity — one crack and the school splits. Hakumon's ramen shop crisis and the missing Polewater expedition are forcing them to divide already-thin resources.

---

## 11. Dawn Blossom Guild

- **Type:** Currency minting / economic guild
- **Leaders:** Secretive sages (identities hidden)
- **Region:** Island-wide influence
- **Traits:** Calculating, Neutral

### Agents
- **The Assessor** — Masked figure who appears at markets to evaluate currency circulation. No one knows their real identity. Speaks formally, never makes small talk, carries a First Age coin-pressing stamp.
- **Mint-Keeper Pollu** — Oversees a hidden minting facility. Friendly with merchants, trades gossip for ingredient leads. Only person who openly admits working for Dawn Blossom.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Wealth | Sole authority to mint Gold Flowers, Sea Petals, and Copper Buds |
| Apparatus | First Age coin-pressing machinery enchanted with spirit magic |
| Resources | Vault of pure spirit essence used in minting enchantments |
| Anonymity | Leadership identities hidden — can't be pressured politically |
| Position | Control the entire island's economy through currency supply |

### Agenda
1. Secure a reliable supply of crimson octopus ink from Lionfish King's octopus
2. Acquire rare ingredients from Fish Head Coven for new coin enchantment batches
3. Collect working First Age vending machines to expand coin distribution
4. Maintain currency stability despite Corruption disrupting eastern trade
5. Prevent any faction from gaining enough power to threaten the monetary system

### Obstacle
Dependent on two hostile factions for critical resources: the Lionfish King controls the only crimson octopus (ink source), and the Fish Head Coven controls magical ingredients for enchantments. Both leverage this dependency for favorable exchange rates.

### Want
Reliable octopus ink supply (Lionfish King). Coven ingredients (Fish Head). First Age vending machines (scattered across island). Will pay well and stay neutral in conflicts — unless the money is threatened.

### Tension
The invisible hand. Every faction needs their currency. They maintain strict neutrality but could tip any conflict by withholding or flooding coin supply. Someone is counterfeiting, and they want it stopped.

---

## 12. Flying Phin's Airship Service

- **Type:** Aviation obsessive / airfield hermit — mechanic-for-hire specializing in flying machines
- **Base:** Broken Bird Airfield (Coastal Highlands) — derelict First Age airstrip with skeletal aircraft, a pair of modest hangars, and an air traffic control tower occupied by harpies. Prickly shrubs through cracked runway. Red-orange lichen on everything. Notorious and dangerous.
- **Leaders:** Phin (sole operator)
- **Region:** Coastal Highlands
- **Traits:** Obsessive, Resourceful

### Agents
- **Phin** — (male human). Old man, former AHA member, has lived at the airfield longer than anyone — including the harpies, which he calls "those dumb birds who are always stealing my tools." Lives in a ramshackle loft built from scaffolding inside one of the hangars. Devoted his life to restoring a First Age aircraft he lovingly calls "the Menace." Disheveled. Takes the occasional commission cobbling together flying machines for paying customers — business is slow. His machines can only stay aloft for limited durations, if they get off the ground at all — often sputtering out on the runway to a chorus of cackling harpies. Grows cucumbers behind the hangars to make pickles. Eats pickles constantly and bathes daily in pickle brine — the harpies despise vinegar, which is the only reason they won't eat him. Carries his most prized tools on his person. "I'll get this hunk of junk flying, just you watch!"
- **Plitsu** — (spirit). Adorable little spectral spirit and the TRUE reason for Phin's repeated failures. Believes First Age flight technology needs to remain grounded. Has been secretly stealing Phin's tools — not the harpies. Uses its cuteness to win over visitors and paints Phin as the villain. Has a cache of stolen tools hidden in a nearby copse of trees. Phin blames the harpies and has no idea.
- **Bomber** — (harpy). Hulking harpy with clipped wings — unable to fly. Fascinated by aircraft, spends her time sitting in cockpits of derelict planes. Wants to learn from Phin but can't bring herself to ask — the other harpies would frown on fraternizing. Has valuable information she'll trade if someone helps her fly again. Desperate.
- **Gouger, Cutya, and Strafe** — (harpies). Gang leadership of the 12 harpies occupying the control tower. Gouger is the self-proclaimed captain — quiet, cunning, even-keeled, deadpan humor, can outdrink any harpy. Cutya is bloodthirsty and cruel with a penchant for nakudama flesh ("oh so succulent"). Strafe is the most approachable, which makes her the most dangerous — lulls people into false security. All 12 dress as pilots with flight jackets, scarves, and goggles. Spend nights in rowdy revelry: smoking, bawdy jokes, gambling at "rusty spades." Drunk into collective stupor by morning.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Apparatus | Multiple First Age aircraft frames in various states of repair, "the Menace" restoration project, runway (cracked but functional), two hangars full of salvageable parts |
| Information | Airplane plans stored in the control tower (currently in harpy territory). Phin's former AHA membership gives him deep knowledge of First Age mechanics |
| Specialization | Phin is one of the best flying machine mechanics Obojima has to offer — even if results are limited |
| Position | Dangerous but tantalizing airfield — a rite of passage for Young Stewards, a destination for anyone fascinated by First Age flight |

### Agenda
1. Get the Menace airworthy — restore it to sustained powered flight
2. Figure out why his tools keep disappearing (he blames the harpies — it's actually Plitsu)
3. Retrieve the airplane plans from inside the harpy-occupied control tower
4. Find spirits willing to power a biplane engine (large First Age vehicles may require multiple spirits in concert)
5. Achieve real flight — and eventually reach the Sky King's domain or the Vanishing Mountain

### Obstacles
**Long-term:** Everything conspires against flight at Broken Bird Airfield. Plitsu is secretly sabotaging his work and Phin doesn't know. The airplane plans he needs are locked in the harpy-occupied control tower. Powered flight requires multiple spirits working in concert — extremely rare. An enormous dormant slime colony lives beneath the cracked runway — drawn to machines, they'd emerge as a flood if anything heavy trundles down the strip, latching onto aircraft and adding catastrophic weight. Neither Phin nor the harpies know how big the colony is. And if he ever succeeds at sustained flight, the noise will wake Rumble Hill — actually a Cat of Prodigious Size sleeping nearby (a former housecat named Lyle from Opal Falls who kept growing). Once awakened, it fixates on movement. A flying machine barreling down the runway would be "the most enticing plaything."

**Immediate:** A group of Young Stewards snuck onto the airfield as part of a dare — sneaking in and returning with a trinket is a rite of passage. They haven't come back and are believed to be in the harpies' clutches. Meanwhile, Bomber has been approaching visitors, offering valuable information in exchange for help flying again. She could be the key to a truce with the harpies — or helping her could turn the entire gang hostile. Phin doesn't know Bomber exists as a potential ally; he's too busy cursing the harpies for stealing tools that Plitsu actually took.

### Want
His tools back (from Plitsu, though he doesn't know that). The airplane plans from the control tower. Spirits willing to power the Menace. To be left alone to work — but he'll accept help if it comes with no strings attached.

### Tension
Phin's former AHA membership is a live connection — AHA wants access to the airfield's tech archive and would trade research. Rock Raley's aviation craze in Sky Kite Valley is the competition — Raley has a team, funding, and public support while Phin works alone in pickle brine. The harpies are an uneasy coexistence — Bomber's desperation could fracture the balance. Plitsu's sabotage is invisible to everyone — if discovered, it reframes Phin's decades-long failure as spirit interference, not incompetence.

---

## 13. Goro Goros

- **Type:** Youth street gang
- **Base:** Yatamon City
- **Leaders:** Tatsu (gang leader), Mikiko (witch apprentice)
- **Region:** Gift of Shuritashi
- **Traits:** Defiant, Creative

### Agents
- **Tatsu** — Gang leader. Charismatic troublemaker with a genuine grudge against Yatamon's elite. Tags buildings with elaborate magical graffiti that tells stories. Found in the underground tunnels or on rooftops.
- **Mikiko** — Witch apprentice who creates the magic ink. Secretly a Fish Head Coven trainee — the coven doesn't know she's sharing magic with street kids. Torn between loyalty to the gang and fear of coven punishment.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Magic | Magical graffiti ink (Mikiko's creation — tags that move, whisper, and resist removal) |
| Information | Intimate knowledge of Yatamon's underground First Age subway tunnels |
| Apparatus | Stash of First Age spray paint cans that amplify magical ink effects |
| Subterfuge | Street-level eyes and ears across Yatamon's markets and alleys |
| Popularity | Folk heroes among Yatamon's working class |

### Agenda
1. Tag every Canden & Moon building with moving graffiti — public humiliation campaign
2. Acquire a cassette tape ward spell from Fish Head Coven to protect their tunnels
3. Discover what's at the end of the sealed subway tunnels beneath Yatamon
4. Prove street magic is as legitimate as coven witchery
5. Be taken seriously as a real faction, not dismissed as delinquents

### Obstacle
Mikiko's double life. If Fish Head Coven discovers she's teaching magic to unlicensed street kids, they'll demand her return and possibly punish the gang. The gang's power depends entirely on her ink — without Mikiko, they're just kids with spray paint.

### Want
A cassette tape ward spell (Fish Head has them). Canden & Moon publicly embarrassed. Recognition from any adult faction that they matter.

### Tension
Mikiko's secret is a ticking bomb. Canden & Moon's Student Captain Reiko is hunting them. The sealed subway tunnels could connect to the Wandering Line — or something worse. Fish Head's Whisper (the tea vendor spy) may already suspect Mikiko.

---

## 14. Council of Kroo

- **Type:** Eccentric hermit council
- **HQ:** Tree houses in the Crawling Canopy
- **Leaders:** Edgarton Hargreaves III
- **Members:** 4 — Penelope Mibblethorpe (witch), Sheldrake Wobbledrain (warlock), Thurston Smorkwaggle
- **Region:** Gale Fields (Crawling Canopy)
- **Traits:** Eccentric, Paranoid

### Agents
- **Edgarton Hargreaves III** — Self-appointed spokesman. Wears seven hats stacked on his head. Speaks in riddles that occasionally contain genuine cosmic truths. Found at the Wicked Wizard Tavern or up a tree.
- **Thurston Smorkwaggle** — The Council's "external affairs minister." Actually just wanders the Gale Fields muttering. Accidentally gives useful directions to lost travelers. Carries a bag of floppy disks he calls "the keys."

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Apparatus | Working First Age chunky computer used for "cosmic calculations" |
| Information | Floppy disks that may be vault keys to something buried underground |
| Magic | Control of the Crawling Canopy's movement (they guide the mobile forest) |
| Position | The Wicked Wizard Tavern — hidden meeting place inside the Canopy |
| Anonymity | Everyone dismisses them as harmless eccentrics |

### Agenda
1. Keep the Fish Head Coven's scouts out of the Crawling Canopy
2. Complete the "cosmic calculations" on the First Age computer
3. Determine if the thing buried beneath the Canopy is actually a superweapon or just a very large machine
4. If it's dangerous, ensure it stays buried forever
5. If it's useful, figure out how to activate it without destroying the island

### Obstacle
The Fish Head Coven suspects the Canopy hides something valuable and sends regular scouting parties. The Council can move the forest to evade them, but each move disrupts the "cosmic calculations" and delays answers about what's buried below.

### Want
Fish Head Coven to leave them alone. More floppy disks (scattered across island in First Age ruins). Someone who can actually program the computer — their "calculations" are mostly trial and error.

### Tension
The Fish Head Coven's interest is intensifying. If the buried thing is real, it could be the most significant discovery since the First Age. The Council is genuinely unsure if they're protecting the island or sitting on its destruction.

## 15. Tellu & Scale's School of Blades

- **Type:** Nomadic sword school
- **HQ:** None — migrates along western coast
- **Leaders:** Master Tellu (nakudama), Master Scale
- **Region:** Western coast (Gift of Shuritashi)
- **Traits:** Philosophical, Restless

### Agents
- **Master Tellu** — Ancient nakudama swordmaster. Carries a First Age stopwatch with functions nobody has decoded. Speaks in koans. Trains students while walking — the school literally never stops moving.
- **Wanderer Ishi** — Former student turned recruiter. Travels ahead of the school, identifying worthy candidates and safe campgrounds. Practical, world-weary, excellent cook. Carries oral histories in her memory.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Apparatus | Master Tellu's First Age stopwatch (heirloom with mysterious undecoded functions) |
| Information | Oral history of pre-First Age Obojima that no written record preserves |
| Specialization | "The Tempered Mind" — unmatched philosophical sword training |
| Beliefs | Nomadic philosophy that attracts devoted students |

### Agenda
1. Negotiate safe passage through Fish Head Coven territory in the Gale Fields
2. Reach the Lilywin ruins — Tellu believes the lost nakudama capital holds the school's founding story
3. Decode the stopwatch's hidden functions (may require AHA or Council of Kroo's computer)
4. Discover whether the school has a legitimate claim to Lilywin
5. Settle at Lilywin if the claim holds — becoming the first sword school with ancient roots

### Obstacle
Fish Head Coven controls the Gale Fields. They won't grant passage without something in return — and Tellu's nakudama heritage may give the school a legitimate claim to Lilywin that threatens Coven territorial dominance. The Coven would rather the ruins stay forgotten.

### Want
Passage through Gale Fields (Fish Head controls). Lilywin ruins access. Someone to decode the stopwatch (AHA or Council of Kroo). Their oral histories could be priceless to AHA if they ever agreed to share.

### Tension
Fish Head sees them as a territorial threat. AHA would trade anything for their oral histories. The stopwatch may be connected to whatever the Council of Kroo is computing. Canden & Moon sees a nomadic school settling down as validating a rival.

## 16. The Crowsworn

- **Type:** Witch coven
- **HQ:** Brackwater Wetlands
- **Region:** Brackwater Wetlands
- **Traits:** Desperate, Resourceful

### Agents
- **Crow Mother Vex** — Coven leader. Surrounded by a permanent murder of crows that serve as scouts and messengers. Gaunt, intense, hasn't slept properly in months. Found at their wetland compound or wherever the Corruption is worst.
- **Brewer Thistle** — Potion specialist experimenting with Corruption-resistance brews. Every batch is slightly different. Test subjects include herself — her left arm has a faint dark sheen she hides under long sleeves.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Magic | 1 Almanac volume (Brackwater Wetlands region) |
| Specialization | Experimental Corruption-resistance potions (partially working) |
| Information | Network of crow familiars providing intelligence across eastern Obojima |
| Apparatus | First Age propane burners repurposed for rapid cauldron work |
| Alliances | Closest magical ally to Rangers of the Greenward Path |

### Agenda
1. Obtain Mariners' Guild underwater Corruption samples (different strain than land Corruption)
2. Compare land and sea Corruption to identify a common vulnerability
3. Brew a reliable Corruption-resistance potion (current success rate: ~40%)
4. Acquire Fish Head's Shallows Almanac volume for underwater ingredient knowledge
5. Deploy a mass countermeasure before the Corruption crosses the wetlands boundary

### Obstacle
Fish Head Coven has the Shallows Almanac volume describing underwater ingredients critical to the cure. They'll only trade it for the Crowsworn's own Brackwater volume — giving it up means losing their regional foraging advantage at the worst possible time.

### Want
Mariners' Guild underwater Corruption samples. Fish Head's Shallows Almanac volume. Rangers' field data on Corruption progression. Clean ingredients from uncorrupted land (getting harder to find).

### Tension
If they fall, the east's magical defense collapses. Brewer Thistle may already be partially corrupted — is her research compromised? Fish Head's demand for a volume trade feels like extortion while the world burns. The Rangers trust them completely — betraying that trust is unthinkable.

## 17. The Deep Current

- **Type:** Secret society (shadow faction)
- **HQ:** None — cells embedded across other factions
- **Leader:** Unknown ("the Voice" — communicates through intermediaries and dead drops)
- **Region:** Island-wide (hidden)
- **Traits:** Patient, Fanatical

### Agents
- **Krocius** — Primary operative. Male nakudama posing as a Second Age scholar inside AHA. Partnered with Dr. Frond on the Yatamon undercity excavation, steering the dig toward passages that lead deeper — toward Mount Arbora's core. Reserved, soft-spoken, lets others do the talking. AHA has no idea.
- **Morgo** — Lost operative. Sage spirit sent into the Crawling Canopy 20 years ago to find evidence of the ancient battle between the Sky King and Oghmai — specifically proof of where the demon was imprisoned. Never came back. The Deep Current doesn't know if he's dead, lost, or if the Canopy swallowed him. (He's alive, still searching, losing his mind.)
- **Ermina Flopfoot** — Unwitting asset. Crowsworn witch who has independently studied Oghmai texts. Believes a girl named Madelaine in the Brackwater suffers from the same sickness that turned Oghmai into a demon. Doesn't know the Deep Current exists, but they're watching her research closely.
- **Unknown others** — At least one operative likely embedded in Lom & Salt's school (proximity to Mount Arbora) and possibly among the Wandering Line's passengers.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Subterfuge | Members hidden inside AHA and possibly other factions — no one knows the society exists |
| Information | Ancient nakudama texts describing Oghmai's imprisonment, the seal's construction, and the prison's general location (center of Mount Arbora) |
| Position | Krocius has direct access to AHA's dig and subway tunnel mapping |
| Beliefs | Conviction that Oghmai's power is the key to nakudama restoration — willing to risk everything |

### Agenda
1. Use Krocius's position in AHA to map the subway tunnels beneath Yatamon — they may connect to the Wandering Line network and ultimately to the Prison depot
2. Locate the Wandering Line depot at the Prison of Oghmai inside Mount Arbora
3. Recover or reconstruct the seal-breaking ritual from scattered nakudama texts
4. Gain access to the Prison and harness Oghmai's power — or free him outright
5. Restore nakudama to their former greatness using the demon emperor's might

### Obstacle
The Prison is inside Mount Arbora, but they can't just dig there — Cloud Cap Coven guards the mountain's sacred sites and would violently oppose intrusion. The Wandering Line is unpredictable and requires special tickets. The subway tunnels beneath Yatamon have mostly collapsed. And the seal itself was created by Shalwin's most powerful mages — breaking it may require knowledge or artifacts that no longer exist.

### Want
AHA's subway tunnel maps (Krocius is working on it). Wandering Line access and schedule knowledge. Cloud Cap Coven's mountain spirit pathway maps. The Council of Kroo's floppy disks — their "cosmic calculations" may relate to the prison's seal. Ermina Flopfoot's Oghmai research.

### Tension
If AHA discovers Krocius's true purpose, the entire operation collapses. Cloud Cap Coven would declare war on anyone digging into the mountain. The Council of Kroo may be sitting on top of something related — their buried "superweapon or very large machine" could be connected to the prison. Lom & Salt's forge expansion near the summit could accidentally breach something. And the biggest question: is the Corruption itself connected to Oghmai's imprisonment? Is freeing him the cure — or the catastrophe?

## The Corruption Axis

The spreading Corruption is the meta-threat that could force rivals to cooperate — or tear alliances apart.

| Stance | Factions |
|--------|----------|
| **Fighting it** | Mariners' Guild, Rangers, Crowsworn, Toraf & Boulder |
| **Studying it** | AHA, Cloud Cap Coven |
| **Ignoring it** | Fish Head Coven, Lionfish King, Dawn Blossom, Canden & Moon |
| **Profiting from it** | Dawn Blossom (economic disruption = currency demand) |
| **Exploiting it?** | The Deep Current (believes Oghmai's power could cure — or caused — it) |

---
