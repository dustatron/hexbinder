## 1. Mariners' Guild

- **Type:** Undersea explorers guild
- **HQ:** Four lodges at cardinal points (northern & southern active)
- **Leaders:** Captain Clintock (founder), Holly Clintock (north), Paloma Clintock (south)
- **Region:** Island-wide
- **Traits:** Tenacious, Resourceful

### Agents
- **Captain Clintock** — Guild founder. Man of few words but commanding presence. Insatiably curious, driven, introspective. Wears a uniform tailored to match a ship captain from his favorite First Age action figure series. Currently at the southern lodge researching Corruption samples. Loves his daughters more than anything except the sea.
- **Holly Clintock** — Captain's younger daughter. Gifted engineer and shipwright, runs the northern lodge at Pelican's Nest Lighthouse. Optimistic, sense of wonder, prefers workshop work to people. Always has useful tools hanging from her belt, talks to them like old friends. Designed the current Pointue and diving suits. Currently building hull patch for the sub and designing a new ship called the Windward. Lionfish King's #1 target.
- **Paloma Clintock** — Captain's eldest daughter, caretaker of southern lodge. Fearless bordering on reckless. Values lodge members as closer than family. Built her own catamaran the Shrike, wears a magical cloak of mist. Launching solo raids into Lionfish King's domain. Secret: recently infected with Corruption from a fish folk dart — hasn't told anyone.
- **Marcel** — Lighthouse keeper at Pelican's Nest. Broad-shouldered, tall, thick mustache, blind. Navigates using Holly's modified First Age fish finder (sonar rig). Tattooed arms depicting mythical marine life. Accompanied by a pelican spirit named Disaster. Mutual familial bond with Holly though neither admits it.
- **Figby** — Nakudama naturalist, musician, chef, and freediver extraordinaire. Boisterous, quick to laugh. "The glue that keeps the lodge together." Morning dives for fish, cooks meals, plays accordion. Discovered that the spirit Ogo Mo Vogo will transport trusted people to the seafloor. Currently tracking a rare "strobe fish."
- **Leobini** — Ancient navigator, Captain's closest friend. Moves with the help of a crab-like spirit named Mr. Tamlin who carries him on its back. Has a thousand stories about sea monsters, brave sailors, and foolish captains. Lived at the lodge longer than anyone.
- **Dahlia** — Elf apprentice diver. Orphaned (father died on Land of Hot Water excursion, mother died months prior). Bookworm who investigates First Age objects from the Shallows. Owns the island's largest action figure collection. Assisting Captain Clintock with Corruption research.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Apparatus | The Pointue submarine (damaged, in drydock at southern lodge) |
| Specialization | Diving suits, fish finder/sonar tech, deep-water expertise |
| Information | Corruption research samples and underwater survey data |
| Position | Four lodges at compass points give island-wide coastal presence |
| Resources | Salvaged First Age navigation beacons still pulsing with magic |

### Agenda
1. Gather enough Corruption samples from the Shallows to identify the source
2. Convince AHA to share First Age submarine schematics for repair
3. Repair the Pointue's hull and navigation systems
4. Recover the Aquatic Stabilizer from the Lionfish King's Doomspine
5. Launch a deep-water expedition to find the Corruption's origin point

### Obstacle
The Aquatic Stabilizer — the First Age magic gyroscope critical for deep-current navigation — is mounted on the Lionfish King's flagship Doomspine. Without it, the Pointue can't safely navigate the deep Shallows.

### Want
The Aquatic Stabilizer. They'd also accept AHA's help reverse-engineering a replacement, but AHA wants underwater ruin access in return.

### Tension
Lionfish King sank the original Pointue and took the Stabilizer. Clintock got the King imprisoned in Uluwa. Decades-long blood feud. Neither will negotiate directly — players make ideal intermediaries.

---

## 2. Domain of the Lionfish King

- **Type:** Underwater kingdom
- **HQ:** Coral Castle in the Shallows
- **Leader:** The Lionfish King
- **Region:** Western Shallows (offshore)
- **Traits:** Grandiose, Vain

### Agents
- **The Lionfish King** — Fish folk. Self-proclaimed monarch of the Western Shallows. Pompous, moody, vain, egotistical — but not a psychopath. Can be reasoned with if skewed in his favor. Rules by bullying and guile, no qualms about breaking his word. Fearful of the Corruption encroaching on his reef. Ultimate goal: marry a descendant of nakudama queen Okumi for true royal status. Bristling mane of spines betrays his mood.
- **Sleethar** — Moray eel royal consigliere and ocean mage. Fears his lord, under constant pressure to crack the Royal Lineages. Cowardly but shrewd and cunning — knows how to placate and manipulate the King. One slip and his head joins the others who toyed too carelessly with the monarch. Could be an ally if approached carefully.
- **Bloodfin the Foul** — Exiled female fish folk captain, leads a pirate band from a sunken First Age town (old Goodie Mart as her lair). Desperately wants back into the King's good graces. Being manipulated by sea hag Slurpgill who wants to turn her into a hag. A wild card — could rejoin the King or defect to Venomous Rex.
- **Borisss** — Sea snake spirit, fiercely loyal to Bloodfin. Coiled around a teddy bear he found when the gang first arrived. Found in Bloodfin's sunken town.
- **Morris** — Giant seahorse spirit. Cowardly, intimidated into serving Bloodfin. Terrified of Slurpgill. Will lie to or tattle on outsiders to survive. Hangs out in Moxy's Music Grotto (sunken First Age music store).
- **Lucinda** — Awakened giant octopus, gentle creature. Bloodfin holds her eggs hostage in a giant clam, forcing Lucinda to act as junkyard dog. Fears both Bloodfin and Slurpgill. A rescue target.
- **Slurpgill** — Sea hag, not technically a subject but a shadow power over Bloodfin's exile band. Wants to build a coven by turning Bloodfin into a hag. All water spirits tremble at her name. Lair location unknown. Designed as a recurring underwater nemesis.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Force | Elite crab sentinels, barracuda warriors, fish folk pirates |
| Apparatus | The Doomspine war barge (with Aquatic Stabilizer in stolen Pointue prow — Stabilizer created by Clintock's late wife Kara) |
| Position | Coral Castle underwater fortress |
| Information | The Royal Lineages — 2 ancient tomes tracking nakudama royal bloodline |
| Resources | The crimson octopus "Boombox" (produces priceless magical ink) |
| Renown | Self-proclaimed king of the Shallows, feared by coastal settlements |

### Agenda
1. Hire surface-dweller mercenaries to assassinate Holly Clintock — she's the only one who can repair the Pointue. Kill the engineer, kill the submarine forever.
2. Decipher the Royal Lineages to identify a living nakudama royal heir
3. Locate the heir and arrange a marriage alliance (willing or not)
4. Hold a coronation ceremony legitimizing his rule in the spirit realm
5. Destroy Captain Clintock and sink whatever's left of his fleet
6. Expand territory from the Shallows into coastal waters

### Obstacle
The Royal Lineages are written in cryptic nakudama code. His wizard Sleethar has failed to crack it. He needs AHA's translation expertise — but approaching surface-dwellers openly would undermine his authority. Meanwhile, Venomous Rex's corrupted deep-sea fish folk encroach from the east, forcing him to fight on two fronts.

### Want
A scholar who can decipher the Royal Lineages. Would trade almost anything except the Aquatic Stabilizer (his flagship's heart) or the octopus.

### Tension
Has what Mariners' Guild desperately needs (Stabilizer). Needs what AHA has (translation). Dawn Blossom Guild needs his octopus ink for currency. Venomous Rex's deep-sea raiders pressure him from the east. Some vassals are secretly friendly to Clintock's daughters and open to cooperation against the Corruption. Multiple leverage points for player manipulation.

---

## 3. Archaeologists, Historians & Archivists (AHA)

- **Type:** Academic guild
- **HQ:** Observatory on a promontory overlooking the ocean, southeastern Coastal Highlands
- **Leaders:** The Asloh — Gurriko (nakudama archaeologist, ancient building techniques), Loninni (human historian, Mount Arbora foothills), Uba (towering blue dara, chief archivist)
- **Region:** Island-wide (dozen+ field sites), HQ in southeastern Coastal Highlands
- **Traits:** Curious, Cautious

### Agents
- **Uba** — Chief Archivist (male blue dara). Stays at HQ overseeing the Archive. Not miserly — happy to share with genuinely interested visitors. Teacher mentality, believes everyone can contribute worthy ideas. Carries a secret shame: once let a charlatan scholar steal a tome detailing Mount Arbora cave networks.
- **Lonzo** — Telescope Operator (male human). Grizzled, grumbly, voice like gravel. Oldest AHA member. Spends time alone at the HQ telescope, nodding off occasionally as he charts stars. A First Age radio he keeps emits white noise interrupted by mysterious snippets in a garbled language he claims are "dispatches about some war."
- **Chloe** — Archaeologist (female elf). Wizard obsessed with First Age technology. Found in her workshop among partially assembled devices, scattered tools, and half a dozen companion spirits. Specialty: cassette players. Avid collector of First Age music — the louder, the better.
- **Vutochi** — Corruption Researcher (cat spirit). Foremost expert on the Corruption. Dispassionate air, appears disengaged or enters trances. Exists in both the Physical Realm and Spirit Realm simultaneously, shifting attention between planes. In the Spirit Realm, transforms into a tall imposing mage. Searches the eastern coastline and Brackwater for fish that escaped skeletonization.
- **Mortimus Fids** — Head Curator of the Yatamon library outpost (male human). About twenty AHA members work at this First Age library. Mortimus rules with self-importance and snobbery that makes everyone loathe him. Will make adventurers grovel, ego-stroke, and jump through hoops before sharing information.
- **Dr. Zalia Frond** — Archaeologist (female human). Leads the ongoing underground excavation beneath Yatamon's undercity. Affable, enthusiastic. Partnered with Krocius.
- **Krocius** — Claimed Second Age scholar (male nakudama). Reserved, soft-spoken, lets Dr. Frond do the talking. Secretly using Frond and AHA to delve into dangerous areas searching for the lost prison of ancient nakudama emperor Oghmai.
- **Isabel Skiff** — Field researcher (female human). High-society AHA member stationed at Toggle. Hunting for a rare gemstone called a dragon's fist. Well-funded, dapper clothes, sticks out among miners — but earnest about rolling up her sleeves.
- **Dini** — Field researcher (nakudama). Leads expeditions to Shoom, an abandoned Nakudama Age site.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Information | Largest First Age tech archive — computers, floppy disks, arcade cabinets (Detective Werewolf Saga), radios, VHS tapes, cassette players |
| Specialization | Translation expertise for First Age languages and codes; deciphered much of First Age language |
| Members | Field research teams at dozen+ excavation sites; ~20 staff at Yatamon library outpost; chronicler spirits (dozen robed spirits that take dictation on scroll strips) |
| Position | 19-level observatory HQ with telescope, labs, archive, curio museum; Yatamon library outpost (First Age library) |
| Resources | First Age canned food stockpile, preserved artifacts, refurbished telescope tracking stars and flying beasts |
| Vulnerability | Flooded lowest levels secretly occupied by corrupted viperfish folk loyal to Venomous Rex, seeking entry into HQ |

### Agenda
1. Explore the ancient subway tunnels beneath Yatamon — Dr. Frond's dig is pushing deeper into the undercity, mapping collapsed passages and First Age infrastructure
2. Discover where the Wandering Line goes and what its depot network connects to — the subway system may have once linked terminals across the island
3. Research the Corruption — housing infected rangers in HQ labs, studying skeletonized fish in aquariums, losing researchers to exposure. Theories: it may be seeping into groundwater, may respond as one organism, may be hunting the island's spirit life force
4. Investigate the stellar anomaly — constellations have shifted, star movements are slowing. Debate: are the sky spirits calming, or has the island itself stopped drifting?
5. Gain access to underwater ruins via Mariners' Guild submarine
6. Decode Lonzo's mysterious radio "war dispatches" — who is broadcasting?
7. Find the Disappearing Mountain — appeared on the northeast horizon, traveled south for two days, then vanished. Expedition sent to find it never returned. Still obsesses a small group of members.

### Obstacle
Spread too thin. Field researchers are falling ill from Corruption exposure. The most critical underwater ruins require the Mariners' Guild submarine, but the Guild demands Corruption research help first. The Yatamon subway dig keeps hitting collapsed tunnels and dangerous creatures. Resources pulled in every direction.

### Want
Underwater First Age ruin access (Mariners' Guild has it). The Royal Lineages (Lionfish King has them) — could trade translation services but that would legitimize a tyrant. Safe passage through subway tunnels. Answers about the Wandering Line depot network.

### Tension
Natural partnership with Mariners' Guild but competing priorities. Could be kingmaker in the Lionfish King conflict — whoever they help wins. Phin was once AHA, wants to keep airfield tech to himself. Lom & Salt want metallurgy manuals from the archive. Krocius is secretly using Frond's dig to hunt for the Prison of Oghmai — AHA doesn't know their own researcher has a hidden agenda. Viperfish folk have infiltrated the flooded HQ basement.

---

## 4. Fish Head Coven

- **Type:** Most powerful witch coven
- **HQ:** Witching Tower — three brick towers in the Gale Fields
- **Leaders:** Council of Three and Thirty (3 witches + The Thirty amalgamated spirit)
- **Region:** Gale Fields (HQ), island-wide influence
- **Traits:** Domineering, Secretive

### Agents
- **Bim of the Beasts** — Field witch and ingredient hunter. Travels with a menagerie of enchanted animals. Friendly on the surface, utterly loyal to the Council. Found wherever rare ingredients grow.
- **Whisper** — Spy embedded in Yatamon's markets. Collects gossip and tracks rival coven movements. Appears as a cheerful tea vendor. Reports directly to the Council.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Magic | 2 Almanac volumes (Gale Fields & Shallows regions), cassette tape spell scrolls |
| Apparatus | First Age cassette players repurposed as spellcasting foci |
| Subterfuge | Network of affiliated witches embedded in settlements across island |
| Position | Two sealed vaults called the "Closed Fists" (contents unknown) |
| Renown | Recognized as most powerful coven — other covens defer or resent them |

### Agenda
1. Locate the covens holding the remaining 5 Almanac volumes
2. Acquire volumes through trade, trickery, or intimidation — starting with Cloud Cap's
3. Obtain Spirit Coal from the Wandering Line's caboose for a master recipe
4. Open the Closed Fists (even the Council doesn't know what's inside — they need all 7 volumes as keys)
5. Achieve total monopoly over magical ingredient knowledge on Obojima

### Obstacle
Every rival coven guards their Almanac volume with their lives. Direct theft risks open coven war. The Council must acquire them without uniting the other covens against them.

### Want
The 5 remaining Almanac volumes (one per rival coven). Spirit Coal from the Wandering Line. Will trade cassette spell scrolls, ingredient knowledge, or favors — but never their own volumes.

### Tension
Every coven interaction is colored by this rivalry. Goro Goros' Mikiko is secretly a Fish Head apprentice. Council of Kroo's Canopy secrets intrigue them. Dawn Blossom needs their ingredients for currency.

---

## 5. Courier Brigade

- **Type:** Postal knights order
- **HQ:** Fort Harglo (Gale Fields), brigade halls in towns
- **Leaders:** Postmaster General Escalante (Yatamon)
- **Region:** Island-wide
- **Traits:** Dutiful, Stubborn

### Agents
- **Rider Corvo** — Elite courier who runs the dangerous eastern routes. One of the few who's been to Polewater and back since the Corruption spread. Scarred, quiet, rides a massive war-hawk named Gust.
- **Dispatch Chief Yula** — Runs the Yatamon sorting hall from the old First Age bank vault. Bureaucratic but fiercely protective of her couriers. Keeps meticulous route logs.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Position | Fort Harglo — formidable fortress controlling Gale Fields crossroads |
| Force | Elite rapid-response courier squad, trained bird mounts |
| Apparatus | First Age bank vault in Yatamon (working vault door, now HQ) |
| Information | Island-wide postal network — couriers see and hear everything |
| Beliefs | "Deliverance Through Delivery" — unshakeable institutional creed |

### Agenda
1. Map safe routes through eastern corrupted territory using Ranger intel
2. Acquire working First Age vehicles for faster dangerous-zone delivery
3. Establish a fortified relay station in the Brackwater Wetlands
4. Restore full delivery service to Polewater and eastern settlements
5. Earn formal recognition as Obojima's civil defense force (not just mail carriers)

### Obstacle
The Rangers of the Greenward Path have the territory maps and safe-passage knowledge the Brigade needs, but the Rangers are overwhelmed and infected — sharing intel means publicly admitting the eastern front is collapsing.

### Want
Rangers' Corruption territory maps and safe-passage routes. Working First Age motorcycles or kei trucks. Toraf & Boulder's combat-experienced students as route escorts.

### Tension
Loosely allied with Rangers but the alliance is strained by pride on both sides. Fort Harglo's position in Fish Head Coven territory requires a delicate non-aggression arrangement.

---

## 6. Cloud Cap Coven

- **Type:** Mountain witch coven
- **HQ:** Base of Mount Arbora
- **Members:** Including Nuharo (disguised as Grimcloak)
- **Region:** Mount Arbora
- **Traits:** Vigilant, Reclusive

### Agents
- **Nuharo / "Grimcloak"** — Disguised operative who moves between mountain settlements gathering information. Nobody knows Grimcloak is a Cloud Cap witch. Suspicious of outsiders, protective of mountain spirits.
- **Root** — Herb gatherer who tends the high-altitude gardens. Trades rare mountain fungi with travelers. Cheerful but evasive about coven matters. Found on mountain trails.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Magic | 1 Almanac volume (Mount Arbora region) |
| Specialization | Rare high-altitude herbs and fungi found nowhere else |
| Information | Deep knowledge of mountain spirit pathways and sacred sites |
| Subterfuge | Nuharo's network of disguised agents in mountain settlements |

### Agenda
1. Intercept and decode the strange signals emanating from Mount Arbora's peak
2. Acquire a working First Age radio from AHA to listen properly
3. Determine if Lom & Salt's forge expansion threatens spirit sanctuaries
4. Strengthen spirit-ward boundaries around Mount Arbora's sacred sites
5. Discover the source of the peak signals before anyone else does

### Obstacle
They lack the technology to intercept the signals — they need a First Age radio, and AHA has the only working ones. AHA would trade one, but wants access to the mountain's sacred sites in return, which Cloud Cap considers sacrilege.

### Want
A working First Age radio from AHA's archive. Also want Fish Head Coven to stop pressuring them for their Almanac volume.

### Tension
Fish Head Coven constantly pressures for the Almanac volume. Lom & Salt school's forge expansion near the summit encroaches on sacred ground. The signals from the peak could change everything.

---

## 7. Rangers of the Greenward Path

- **Type:** Ranger organization
- **Base:** Brackwater Wetlands
- **Region:** Eastern Obojima
- **Traits:** Grim, Loyal

### Agents
- **Warden Ashka** — Field commander, eastern Corruption front. Half her squad is infected. Makes brutal triage decisions daily. Trusted by Toraf & Boulder but hiding the true casualty count from island leadership.
- **Scout Fennel** — Fastest scout in the wetlands. Runs messages between Ranger outposts and Toraf & Boulder's school. Young, idealistic, not yet infected. Carries hand-drawn Corruption spread maps.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Information | Detailed maps of Corruption spread, updated weekly |
| Specialization | Firsthand knowledge of corrupted territory survival |
| Alliances | Military alliance with Toraf & Boulder's sword school |
| Resources | Field samples of corrupted flora and fauna |
| Conviction | Will not abandon the eastern front regardless of cost |

### Agenda
1. Compare land Corruption samples with Mariners' Guild underwater samples
2. Identify common origin point or vulnerability in the Corruption
3. Develop a field-deployable countermeasure (working with Crowsworn potions)
4. Cure infected rangers before the disease becomes irreversible
5. Push the Corruption boundary back from populated areas

### Obstacle
Many rangers are already infected. Publicly admitting this could cause island-wide panic and withdrawal of support. The Mariners' Guild has the underwater samples they need but demands Corruption territory escorts in return — sending infected rangers underwater risks spreading it.

### Want
Mariners' Guild underwater Corruption samples. Courier Brigade military reinforcements. Crowsworn's experimental Corruption-resistance potions.

### Tension
Most urgent faction — they're losing. Alliance with Toraf & Boulder is strong but both are exhausted. Crowsworn coven is their best magical ally but demands an Almanac volume trade with Fish Head as payment.

---

## 8. Lom & Salt's College of Arms

- **Type:** Oldest sword school
- **HQ:** Mount Arbora upper slopes near summit
- **Leaders:** Master Lom, Master Salt
- **Region:** Mount Arbora
- **Traits:** Traditional, Proud

### Agents
- **Forge-Keeper Duro** — Master smith at the geothermal forge. Obsessed with First Age alloy compositions. Will talk anyone's ear off about metallurgy. Found at the forge, always covered in soot.
- **Signet-Bearer Hara** — Senior student who carries the school's challenge signet. Travels to other schools delivering formal invitations to tournaments. Honorable to a fault, secretly admires Tellu & Scale's philosophy.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Apparatus | Ancient forge heated by Mount Arbora's geothermal vents |
| Specialization | Blade-crafting secrets predating the First Age |
| Resources | Guardian Sphere fragments (ancient nakudama defensive tech) |
| Lineage | Oldest martial institution on Obojima |
| Position | Summit location gives strategic mountain control |

### Agenda
1. Obtain First Age metallurgy manuals from AHA (airplane maintenance docs detail alloy compositions)
2. Acquire Spirit Coal to fuel the forge to First Age temperatures
3. Successfully combine First Age alloys with traditional blade techniques
4. Forge a legendary blade worthy of the school's ancient reputation
5. Present the blade at a grand tournament, re-establishing dominance over rival schools

### Obstacle
The metallurgy manuals are at AHA's archive and Broken Bird Airfield. AHA will trade them only for Guardian Sphere fragments — but those fragments are sacred to the school, and Cloud Cap Coven considers them part of the mountain's heritage.

### Want
First Age metallurgy manuals (AHA has them). Spirit Coal (Wandering Line). Permission from Cloud Cap to expand the forge without violating spirit sanctuaries.

### Tension
Operating in Cloud Cap Coven's territory. Trading Guardian Spheres to AHA would anger Cloud Cap. Canden & Moon's political ambitions threaten their "oldest school" prestige.

---

## 9. Canden & Moon's School

- **Type:** Largest sword school
- **HQ:** Ornate hexagonal structure in Yatamon City
- **Leaders:** Master Canden, Master Moon
- **Region:** Gift of Shuritashi (Yatamon)
- **Traits:** Ambitious, Polished

### Agents
- **Instructor Venn** — Public face of the school, runs recruitment demonstrations in Yatamon's plazas. Charismatic, politically savvy, secretly negotiating with Dawn Blossom Guild for coin recognition.
- **Student Captain Reiko** — Leads the school's patrol squad that "volunteers" for city watch duty. Actually trying to catch Goro Goros taggers. Frustrated, competitive, wants a real fight.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Members | Largest student body on the island |
| Position | Prime location in Yatamon, Obojima's largest city |
| Popularity | Political connections to city governance |
| Apparatus | Extensive First Age vinyl record collection used for training rhythms |
| Wealth | Wealthy patrons fund the school's operations |

### Agenda
1. Expel Goro Goros from Yatamon — their graffiti defaces the hexagonal hall
2. Win a decisive public tournament victory over a rival school
3. Secure Dawn Blossom Guild recognition (school signet on Gold Flower coins)
4. Establish Canden & Moon as Obojima's official civil defense martial academy
5. Absorb or marginalize the other three sword schools

### Obstacle
The Goro Goros street gang openly mocks them, and their magical graffiti resists removal. Violent crackdown would damage the school's polished reputation. They need to outmaneuver the gang, not overpower them.

### Want
Goro Goros gone from Yatamon. A tournament victory (needs a rival school to accept challenge). Dawn Blossom's political endorsement.

### Tension
Goro Goros' Mikiko is secretly Fish Head trained — escalation could draw coven involvement. Toraf & Boulder views their political ambitions as insulting while real fighters die in the east. Lom & Salt considers them pretenders.

---

## 10. Toraf & Boulder's School

- **Type:** Practical combat sword school
- **HQ:** Waterlogged plain in Brackwater Wetlands
- **Leaders:** Master Toraf, Master Boulder
- **Region:** Brackwater Wetlands
- **Traits:** Battle-Hardened, Blunt

### Agents
- **Master Boulder** — Personally leads patrols into corrupted territory. Enormous, speaks in short sentences, judges people by what they do not what they say. Found at the training grounds or the front line.
- **Quartermaster Jig** — Manages supplies and salvage from a nearby submerged First Age garage. Scrounges everything — wrenches, ratchets, car jacks repurposed as training equipment. Practical, never wastes anything.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Force | Battle-hardened students with real combat experience against Corruption |
| Alliances | Military alliance with Rangers of the Greenward Path |
| Apparatus | Salvaged First Age garage tools repurposed for combat training |
| Conviction | Will not retreat from the eastern front |
| Specialization | Only school with actual monster-fighting experience |

### Agenda
1. Request reinforcements from Courier Brigade and Canden & Moon
2. Secure uncorrupted fresh water — their wells are turning brackish
3. Establish a defensible forward position closer to the Corruption boundary
4. Train enough students to rotate front-line shifts without burning out
5. Hold the line until Rangers find a cure

### Obstacle
Asking for help means admitting the east is losing. Canden & Moon has the numbers but their students lack real combat experience — sending them to the front unprepared could be a massacre.

### Want
Courier Brigade soldiers. Canden & Moon students (trained up quickly). Clean water source. Crowsworn's experimental potions for infected allies.

### Tension
Most militarily exposed faction. Respects Rangers deeply but both are exhausted. Contempt for Canden & Moon's political games while real people die. Would accept any help, from any faction, no questions asked.

---

## 11. Dawn Blossom Guild

- **Type:** Currency minting / economic guild
- **Leaders:** Secretive sages (identities hidden)
- **Region:** Island-wide influence
- **Traits:** Calculating, Neutral

### Agents
- **The Assessor** — Masked figure who appears at markets to evaluate currency circulation. No one knows their real identity. Speaks formally, never makes small talk, carries a First Age coin-pressing stamp.
- **Mint-Keeper Pollu** — Oversees a hidden minting facility. Friendly with merchants, trades gossip for ingredient leads. Only person who openly admits working for Dawn Blossom.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Wealth | Sole authority to mint Gold Flowers, Sea Petals, and Copper Buds |
| Apparatus | First Age coin-pressing machinery enchanted with spirit magic |
| Resources | Vault of pure spirit essence used in minting enchantments |
| Anonymity | Leadership identities hidden — can't be pressured politically |
| Position | Control the entire island's economy through currency supply |

### Agenda
1. Secure a reliable supply of crimson octopus ink from Lionfish King's octopus
2. Acquire rare ingredients from Fish Head Coven for new coin enchantment batches
3. Collect working First Age vending machines to expand coin distribution
4. Maintain currency stability despite Corruption disrupting eastern trade
5. Prevent any faction from gaining enough power to threaten the monetary system

### Obstacle
Dependent on two hostile factions for critical resources: the Lionfish King controls the only crimson octopus (ink source), and the Fish Head Coven controls magical ingredients for enchantments. Both leverage this dependency for favorable exchange rates.

### Want
Reliable octopus ink supply (Lionfish King). Coven ingredients (Fish Head). First Age vending machines (scattered across island). Will pay well and stay neutral in conflicts — unless the money is threatened.

### Tension
The invisible hand. Every faction needs their currency. They maintain strict neutrality but could tip any conflict by withholding or flooding coin supply. Someone is counterfeiting, and they want it stopped.

---

## 12. Flying Phin's Airship Service

- **Type:** Transport / aviation
- **Base:** Broken Bird Airfield
- **Region:** Coastal Highlands
- **Traits:** Dreamy, Reckless

### Agents
- **Phin** — The pilot. Obsessed with First Age aviation. Wears a battered flight jacket with faded insignia. Lives in the control tower. Will talk about biplanes until you physically leave. Reckless but lovable.
- **Mechanic Gretta** — Keeps the airfield's machinery running. Built a working glider from scavenged parts. Pragmatic counterweight to Phin's dreams. Secretly believes powered flight is impossible without First Age spirits.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Apparatus | Multiple biplane frames, air traffic control equipment, weather instruments, derelict runway |
| Information | Airplane maintenance manuals (water-damaged but readable) with First Age alloy compositions |
| Resources | Flight jackets with pilot insignia, MRE stockpile, functioning glider |
| Position | Broken Bird Airfield — strategic high-ground overlooking Coastal Highlands |

### Agenda
1. Trade airfield artifact access with AHA for spirit-binding research
2. Find spirits willing to power a biplane engine (requires multiple spirits in concert)
3. Successfully test a short powered flight
4. Establish regular aerial routes between major settlements
5. Fly to the Vanishing Mountain that appeared on the northeast horizon

### Obstacle
Powered flight requires multiple spirits working in concert — extremely rare and dangerous. AHA has research on First Age spirit-binding techniques but won't share without access to the airfield's tech archive, which Phin considers his personal treasure.

### Want
AHA's spirit-binding research. Spirits willing to power an engine. Also intrigued by the Aquatic Stabilizer's gyroscopic principles — could be adapted for flight stabilization.

### Tension
Phin was once an AHA member himself — left to pursue flight obsession. AHA wants access to the airfield's First Age tech archive. A gang of twelve harpies occupies the control tower and steals Phin's tools. Rumble Hill (a giant sleeping cat nearby) could be a problem if the engines get loud.

## 13. Goro Goros

- **Type:** Youth street gang
- **Base:** Yatamon City
- **Leaders:** Tatsu (gang leader), Mikiko (witch apprentice)
- **Region:** Gift of Shuritashi
- **Traits:** Defiant, Creative

### Agents
- **Tatsu** — Gang leader. Charismatic troublemaker with a genuine grudge against Yatamon's elite. Tags buildings with elaborate magical graffiti that tells stories. Found in the underground tunnels or on rooftops.
- **Mikiko** — Witch apprentice who creates the magic ink. Secretly a Fish Head Coven trainee — the coven doesn't know she's sharing magic with street kids. Torn between loyalty to the gang and fear of coven punishment.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Magic | Magical graffiti ink (Mikiko's creation — tags that move, whisper, and resist removal) |
| Information | Intimate knowledge of Yatamon's underground First Age subway tunnels |
| Apparatus | Stash of First Age spray paint cans that amplify magical ink effects |
| Subterfuge | Street-level eyes and ears across Yatamon's markets and alleys |
| Popularity | Folk heroes among Yatamon's working class |

### Agenda
1. Tag every Canden & Moon building with moving graffiti — public humiliation campaign
2. Acquire a cassette tape ward spell from Fish Head Coven to protect their tunnels
3. Discover what's at the end of the sealed subway tunnels beneath Yatamon
4. Prove street magic is as legitimate as coven witchery
5. Be taken seriously as a real faction, not dismissed as delinquents

### Obstacle
Mikiko's double life. If Fish Head Coven discovers she's teaching magic to unlicensed street kids, they'll demand her return and possibly punish the gang. The gang's power depends entirely on her ink — without Mikiko, they're just kids with spray paint.

### Want
A cassette tape ward spell (Fish Head has them). Canden & Moon publicly embarrassed. Recognition from any adult faction that they matter.

### Tension
Mikiko's secret is a ticking bomb. Canden & Moon's Student Captain Reiko is hunting them. The sealed subway tunnels could connect to the Wandering Line — or something worse. Fish Head's Whisper (the tea vendor spy) may already suspect Mikiko.

## 14. Council of Kroo

- **Type:** Eccentric hermit council
- **HQ:** Tree houses in the Crawling Canopy
- **Leaders:** Edgarton Hargreaves III
- **Members:** 4 — Penelope Mibblethorpe (witch), Sheldrake Wobbledrain (warlock), Thurston Smorkwaggle
- **Region:** Gale Fields (Crawling Canopy)
- **Traits:** Eccentric, Paranoid

### Agents
- **Edgarton Hargreaves III** — Self-appointed spokesman. Wears seven hats stacked on his head. Speaks in riddles that occasionally contain genuine cosmic truths. Found at the Wicked Wizard Tavern or up a tree.
- **Thurston Smorkwaggle** — The Council's "external affairs minister." Actually just wanders the Gale Fields muttering. Accidentally gives useful directions to lost travelers. Carries a bag of floppy disks he calls "the keys."

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Apparatus | Working First Age chunky computer used for "cosmic calculations" |
| Information | Floppy disks that may be vault keys to something buried underground |
| Magic | Control of the Crawling Canopy's movement (they guide the mobile forest) |
| Position | The Wicked Wizard Tavern — hidden meeting place inside the Canopy |
| Anonymity | Everyone dismisses them as harmless eccentrics |

### Agenda
1. Keep the Fish Head Coven's scouts out of the Crawling Canopy
2. Complete the "cosmic calculations" on the First Age computer
3. Determine if the thing buried beneath the Canopy is actually a superweapon or just a very large machine
4. If it's dangerous, ensure it stays buried forever
5. If it's useful, figure out how to activate it without destroying the island

### Obstacle
The Fish Head Coven suspects the Canopy hides something valuable and sends regular scouting parties. The Council can move the forest to evade them, but each move disrupts the "cosmic calculations" and delays answers about what's buried below.

### Want
Fish Head Coven to leave them alone. More floppy disks (scattered across island in First Age ruins). Someone who can actually program the computer — their "calculations" are mostly trial and error.

### Tension
The Fish Head Coven's interest is intensifying. If the buried thing is real, it could be the most significant discovery since the First Age. The Council is genuinely unsure if they're protecting the island or sitting on its destruction.

## 15. Tellu & Scale's School of Blades

- **Type:** Nomadic sword school
- **HQ:** None — migrates along western coast
- **Leaders:** Master Tellu (nakudama), Master Scale
- **Region:** Western coast (Gift of Shuritashi)
- **Traits:** Philosophical, Restless

### Agents
- **Master Tellu** — Ancient nakudama swordmaster. Carries a First Age stopwatch with functions nobody has decoded. Speaks in koans. Trains students while walking — the school literally never stops moving.
- **Wanderer Ishi** — Former student turned recruiter. Travels ahead of the school, identifying worthy candidates and safe campgrounds. Practical, world-weary, excellent cook. Carries oral histories in her memory.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Apparatus | Master Tellu's First Age stopwatch (heirloom with mysterious undecoded functions) |
| Information | Oral history of pre-First Age Obojima that no written record preserves |
| Specialization | "The Tempered Mind" — unmatched philosophical sword training |
| Beliefs | Nomadic philosophy that attracts devoted students |

### Agenda
1. Negotiate safe passage through Fish Head Coven territory in the Gale Fields
2. Reach the Lilywin ruins — Tellu believes the lost nakudama capital holds the school's founding story
3. Decode the stopwatch's hidden functions (may require AHA or Council of Kroo's computer)
4. Discover whether the school has a legitimate claim to Lilywin
5. Settle at Lilywin if the claim holds — becoming the first sword school with ancient roots

### Obstacle
Fish Head Coven controls the Gale Fields. They won't grant passage without something in return — and Tellu's nakudama heritage may give the school a legitimate claim to Lilywin that threatens Coven territorial dominance. The Coven would rather the ruins stay forgotten.

### Want
Passage through Gale Fields (Fish Head controls). Lilywin ruins access. Someone to decode the stopwatch (AHA or Council of Kroo). Their oral histories could be priceless to AHA if they ever agreed to share.

### Tension
Fish Head sees them as a territorial threat. AHA would trade anything for their oral histories. The stopwatch may be connected to whatever the Council of Kroo is computing. Canden & Moon sees a nomadic school settling down as validating a rival.

## 16. The Crowsworn

- **Type:** Witch coven
- **HQ:** Brackwater Wetlands
- **Region:** Brackwater Wetlands
- **Traits:** Desperate, Resourceful

### Agents
- **Crow Mother Vex** — Coven leader. Surrounded by a permanent murder of crows that serve as scouts and messengers. Gaunt, intense, hasn't slept properly in months. Found at their wetland compound or wherever the Corruption is worst.
- **Brewer Thistle** — Potion specialist experimenting with Corruption-resistance brews. Every batch is slightly different. Test subjects include herself — her left arm has a faint dark sheen she hides under long sleeves.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Magic | 1 Almanac volume (Brackwater Wetlands region) |
| Specialization | Experimental Corruption-resistance potions (partially working) |
| Information | Network of crow familiars providing intelligence across eastern Obojima |
| Apparatus | First Age propane burners repurposed for rapid cauldron work |
| Alliances | Closest magical ally to Rangers of the Greenward Path |

### Agenda
1. Obtain Mariners' Guild underwater Corruption samples (different strain than land Corruption)
2. Compare land and sea Corruption to identify a common vulnerability
3. Brew a reliable Corruption-resistance potion (current success rate: ~40%)
4. Acquire Fish Head's Shallows Almanac volume for underwater ingredient knowledge
5. Deploy a mass countermeasure before the Corruption crosses the wetlands boundary

### Obstacle
Fish Head Coven has the Shallows Almanac volume describing underwater ingredients critical to the cure. They'll only trade it for the Crowsworn's own Brackwater volume — giving it up means losing their regional foraging advantage at the worst possible time.

### Want
Mariners' Guild underwater Corruption samples. Fish Head's Shallows Almanac volume. Rangers' field data on Corruption progression. Clean ingredients from uncorrupted land (getting harder to find).

### Tension
If they fall, the east's magical defense collapses. Brewer Thistle may already be partially corrupted — is her research compromised? Fish Head's demand for a volume trade feels like extortion while the world burns. The Rangers trust them completely — betraying that trust is unthinkable.

## 17. The Deep Current

- **Type:** Secret society (shadow faction)
- **HQ:** None — cells embedded across other factions
- **Leader:** Unknown ("the Voice" — communicates through intermediaries and dead drops)
- **Region:** Island-wide (hidden)
- **Traits:** Patient, Fanatical

### Agents
- **Krocius** — Primary operative. Male nakudama posing as a Second Age scholar inside AHA. Partnered with Dr. Frond on the Yatamon undercity excavation, steering the dig toward passages that lead deeper — toward Mount Arbora's core. Reserved, soft-spoken, lets others do the talking. AHA has no idea.
- **Morgo** — Lost operative. Sage spirit sent into the Crawling Canopy 20 years ago to find evidence of the ancient battle between the Sky King and Oghmai — specifically proof of where the demon was imprisoned. Never came back. The Deep Current doesn't know if he's dead, lost, or if the Canopy swallowed him. (He's alive, still searching, losing his mind.)
- **Ermina Flopfoot** — Unwitting asset. Crowsworn witch who has independently studied Oghmai texts. Believes a girl named Madelaine in the Brackwater suffers from the same sickness that turned Oghmai into a demon. Doesn't know the Deep Current exists, but they're watching her research closely.
- **Unknown others** — At least one operative likely embedded in Lom & Salt's school (proximity to Mount Arbora) and possibly among the Wandering Line's passengers.

### Advantages
| Type | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Subterfuge | Members hidden inside AHA and possibly other factions — no one knows the society exists |
| Information | Ancient nakudama texts describing Oghmai's imprisonment, the seal's construction, and the prison's general location (center of Mount Arbora) |
| Position | Krocius has direct access to AHA's dig and subway tunnel mapping |
| Beliefs | Conviction that Oghmai's power is the key to nakudama restoration — willing to risk everything |

### Agenda
1. Use Krocius's position in AHA to map the subway tunnels beneath Yatamon — they may connect to the Wandering Line network and ultimately to the Prison depot
2. Locate the Wandering Line depot at the Prison of Oghmai inside Mount Arbora
3. Recover or reconstruct the seal-breaking ritual from scattered nakudama texts
4. Gain access to the Prison and harness Oghmai's power — or free him outright
5. Restore nakudama to their former greatness using the demon emperor's might

### Obstacle
The Prison is inside Mount Arbora, but they can't just dig there — Cloud Cap Coven guards the mountain's sacred sites and would violently oppose intrusion. The Wandering Line is unpredictable and requires special tickets. The subway tunnels beneath Yatamon have mostly collapsed. And the seal itself was created by Shalwin's most powerful mages — breaking it may require knowledge or artifacts that no longer exist.

### Want
AHA's subway tunnel maps (Krocius is working on it). Wandering Line access and schedule knowledge. Cloud Cap Coven's mountain spirit pathway maps. The Council of Kroo's floppy disks — their "cosmic calculations" may relate to the prison's seal. Ermina Flopfoot's Oghmai research.

### Tension
If AHA discovers Krocius's true purpose, the entire operation collapses. Cloud Cap Coven would declare war on anyone digging into the mountain. The Council of Kroo may be sitting on top of something related — their buried "superweapon or very large machine" could be connected to the prison. Lom & Salt's forge expansion near the summit could accidentally breach something. And the biggest question: is the Corruption itself connected to Oghmai's imprisonment? Is freeing him the cure — or the catastrophe?

---

## The Corruption Axis

The spreading Corruption is the meta-threat that could force rivals to cooperate — or tear alliances apart.

| Stance | Factions |
|--------|----------|
| **Fighting it** | Mariners' Guild, Rangers, Crowsworn, Toraf & Boulder |
| **Studying it** | AHA, Cloud Cap Coven |
| **Ignoring it** | Fish Head Coven, Lionfish King, Dawn Blossom, Canden & Moon |
| **Profiting from it** | Dawn Blossom (economic disruption = currency demand) |
| **Exploiting it?** | The Deep Current (believes Oghmai's power could cure — or caused — it) |

---
