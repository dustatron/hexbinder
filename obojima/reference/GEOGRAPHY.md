## Placement Issues in Current Map

1. ⚠️ **Dorrin/Durrin** — Sourcebook says "Dorrin" on Mt Arbora western slopes. Map has "Durrin" at (4,-10) labeled as "northern coastal." Likely same place, needs rename + possible repositioning closer to mountain
2. ⚠️ **Roa Kala** — Sourcebook says Coastal Highlands. Currently at (4,-2) which is center. Should move SE
3. ⚠️ **Opal Falls** — Sourcebook says Coastal Highlands. Currently at (0,2) which is center-south. OK if Coastal Highlands extends there
4. ⚠️ **Kuroki Village** — Not in sourcebook. Custom addition
5. ⚠️ **Crak Caves** — Not in sourcebook. Custom addition
6. ⚠️ **Northern terrain** — Currently forest, should be arid hills (Land of Hot Water)
7. ⚠️ **Center terrain** — Some forest in Gale Fields area should be plains
8. ⚠️ **Mount Arbora** — Only 3 mountain hexes for a 14,000ft peak. Needs 5-7+
