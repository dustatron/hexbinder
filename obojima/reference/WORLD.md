# Obojima World Reference

Macro-level cosmology, history, and secrets. GM-only knowledge marked with [SECRET].

---

## Cosmology

### Two Planes Only
- **Physical Realm** — the material world
- **Spirit Realm** — plane of eternal twilight, overlaid on top of Obojima, occupying the same space
- No multiverse, no other planes. No gods.
- Elder spirits and great beasts are revered instead of deities
- Warlocks get power from spirit patrons; Paladins from faith in spirit concepts
- The island itself is honored more than any single spirit

### Spirit Realm Details
- What appears abandoned in the Physical Realm might be a bustling market in the Spirit Realm
- **Thin Veil** — activity from one realm can sometimes be detected by the other (smudgy images, strange knocking, laughter across planes)
- **Spirit Time** — time moves at different rates between realms (GM adjustable)
- **Entry methods:** spirit portals, spells, the Wandering Line, potions, magic items
- **Leaving** — gates aren't always open; physical beings can get stuck
- **Spirit language:** Torum (generally only heard in the Spirit Realm)

### Spirits
- Vast diversity: nature spirits, elder guardians, shopkeepers, chefs, critters, pests
- **Elder spirits** — ancient, powerful, guard sacred domains. Meeting one is a quest in itself. Some kill intruders like wild animals would.
- **Demons** — spirits that underwent sinful transformation. So filled with malice their bodies twist into caricatures. Lose affinity with Spirit Realm. NOT from hellscapes.
- **Corrupted spirits** — Corruption forces spirits into demon transformation (hours to weeks). Enraged, scared, diabolical, confused.
- **No souls, no ghosts** — "ghost" = a spirit that never leaves the Spirit Realm but can occasionally be sensed

## The Planet

### [SECRET] Ocean World
- The world is an **ocean planet** with many islands
- Most islands **drift across the ocean** on set migrational paths, like living things
- Islands somehow never collide — as if a spirit or instinct keeps them apart
- Each island has its own culture, developed in relative isolation
- Most islands rarely or never cross near enough to see each other on the horizon
- Obojima is one of the world's **smallest islands**
- **Nobody on Obojima knows any of this** — they don't know the island moves (or moved)

### [SECRET] The Vanishing Mountain
- **What people saw:** A mountain appeared on the northeast horizon, traveled south for two days, then vanished
- **What it actually was:** Another drifting island passing by on its own migration path
- Spurred a generation of sailors/explorers — all who ventured out **never returned**
- AHA sent an expedition by boat — **they never came back**
- A small group of AHA members still obsesses over this mystery

### [SECRET] Obojima Is Alive?
- Obojima is magical. Some say the island has a spirit or IS a spirit
- The landmass extends far below the ocean surface — much broader underwater than above
- Before the earthquake, the island actually **moved across the ocean floor**
- How it moves is undiscovered — nobody has gone far enough beyond the Shallows or dived deep enough to see the base

## The Earthquake & Corruption

### What People Know
- A great earthquake struck ~3 months ago
- A tsunami hit the east coast, nearly destroying Polewater
- After the tsunami, the Corruption emerged from the ocean onto Shusha Beach (east coast)
- It has been slowly spreading across the land ever since
- The Corruption skeletonizes sea life, sickens people, turns forests into barren fens
- There is no known cure. Nobody knows how long Obojima has.

### [SECRET] What Actually Happened
- The earthquake was caused by Obojima **crashing into a massive tendril of Corruption** deep underwater
- The sudden stop caused the tsunami
- The impact **halted the island's momentum** — Obojima is now held by the tendril
- The Corruption is a **toxic substance from another world**
- It has no more consciousness than a slime mold or fungus — blindly seeks food with freakish efficiency
- It is a **neutral force of nature** with no inherent malice — like a tornado or lava flow

### Evidence the Island Stopped (Clues Players Can Find)
- **Stars changed:** Constellations that once migrated unpredictably now rise and set in predictable paths (AHA observatory)
- **Current stopped:** A strong east-to-west current suddenly ceased after the earthquake (fisher folk know this)
- **Master Chen's Water Clock** — a giant tower in the Shallows outside Sky Kite Valley where the current turned a wheel running a precise clock. It stopped.
- **The Vanishing Mountain** — was actually another island passing by when Obojima was still drifting

### AHA Corruption Theories (Partially Correct)
- The Corruption may be seeping into groundwater, using it to move throughout the island, polluting wells and springs
- It seems to be in contact with itself — if stimulated, might respond as one massive organism
- Some fear it's hunting for the source of Obojima's life force — the spirit of the island

## History Timeline

### 1. First Age (Prehistory)
- Age of unknown origin. Scholars speculate a people once created the technological wonders scattered across the island
- No understanding of how they came to be or where they went
- Left behind: computers, floppy disks, arcade cabinets, radios, VHS tapes, airplanes, submarines, subway systems, vending machines, spray paint, cassette players, and much more
- AHA has deciphered much of the First Age languages but mysteries remain
- All First Age objects depict only humans — connection between humanity and this era is speculative but suggestive

### 2. Nakudama Age (Second Age)
- **Queen Okumi** — legendary first queen, swam across the cosmic ocean as a tadpole to Mount Arbora's peak. Absorbed her magic tail, used that power to lift Obojima above the waves
- Birthed the first 100 nakudama, founded the kingdom on the shores
- Taught them Naku-Naku language, agriculture, laws of conduct
- Defeated the 10,000 Headed Hydra and the Great Terror Crab
- First to discover First Age artifacts — sent warriors to collect them. The fabled cache was **never found**
- Allowed consort Okka to perish so all nakudama could benefit from a healing mushroom (Queen's Dilemma)
- Eventually disappeared — legends say she vanished, died, or returned to the cosmic sea and will one day return
- **Capital city of Lilywin** — once stretched miles across the Gale Fields. Little archaeological evidence remains. Modern roads may trace its streets.
- Royal dynasties ruled for a thousand years

### 3. Ascent of Oghmai
- **Oghmai** — powerful demon who manipulated two factions among the nakudama, sowed hatred, triggered civil war
- Seized the throne during the chaos — brief but brutal reign
- **Sage Shalwin** led a resistance, overthrew Oghmai
- Oghmai was **deposed and imprisoned** (inside Mount Arbora, accessible via Wandering Line depot)
- The kingdom was left in shambles — nakudama chose to disband the monarchy and rebuild in untouched lands
- In the present day, the queen and royal lineage have fallen into legend and myth

### 4. Age of Humanity (~1200 years ago)
- First humans arrived by boat — no record shows from where
- Nakudama texts state humans brought greater understanding of First Age tech
- Humans and nakudama quickly bonded, established joint settlements still thriving today

### 5. First Elves Born
- An elder spirit blessed the bloodline of humans in Okiri village
- Their children and descendants would sometimes be born as elves — beings connected to the Spirit Realm with marks of power
- Elven births have grown fewer and fewer over time

### 6. Dara Age (Current Era — ~300 years ago)
- The **First Dara** walked out of the forest of Roa Kala
- Initially thought to be a spirit, but proved to be flesh and blood
- Wandered the island telling stories and spreading wisdom
- Inscribed magic glyphs into trees — instructions for future dara who would emerge from sacred trees
- Built the village of Roa Kala as the first place new dara would see
- Widely believed to be an avatar of the island's spirit
- **Where dara come from is a true mystery** — even to the dara themselves
- After wandering for years, returned to the forest

### 7. Vanishing Mountain Sighted
- Another drifting island passed on the horizon — caused great excitement
- Spurred a generation of explorers who ventured out and never returned

### 8. Earthquake & Corruption (Present — ~3 months ago)
- Island crashed into Corruption tendril
- Tsunami devastated east coast
- Corruption spreading westward
- Island is now stuck, held by the tendril

## Malgrotha & The Crawling Canopy

- **Malgrotha** was once a twin spirit: a crow of darkness and a rabbit of light, living in the Spirit Realm
- Someone shot the rabbit in the heart with a cursed arrow (nobody knows who or why)
- The wound split the twin spirit — rabbit writhes in agony in the Spirit Realm, the crow was thrust into the Physical Realm as a ravening demon
- The shambling crow-thing began terrorizing Obojima
- **The First Dara** created the Crawling Canopy 300 years ago as a mobile prison — enchanted trees that surround Malgrotha wherever it goes
- Malgrotha is mindless with rage, cannot scheme, doomed to wander within the forest
- It tears chunks off its own body — those become smaller "Children of Malgrotha" that roam the forest hunting for the First Dara (believing every dara IS the First Dara)

## Great Beasts

Three enormous creatures dwell on Obojima:
- **The Hunter** — enormous bird of prey, constantly in flight
- **Jumaga, the Sky Salamander** — lairs on western slope of Mount Arbora, patrols mountain territory. Farmers make offerings at the Ledge of Offerings
- **Rumble Hill** — a Cat of Prodigious Size, appears as a hill covered in soft orange grass near Broken Bird Airfield. Sleeping. Only the loudest noises will stir it. If awakened, fixates on movement.

## Peoples of Obojima

### Humans
- Arrived ~1200 years ago by boat
- Affinity for First Age tech — all First Age objects depict only humans
- Most populous ancestry
- Elves are born among humans via elder spirit blessing (Okiri bloodline)

### Nakudama
- Frog-like people, oldest inhabitants
- Queen Okumi legend — swam from the cosmic sea
- Sacred language: Naku-Naku
- Once had a great kingdom and capital (Lilywin)
- Fractured by Oghmai's manipulation, monarchy dissolved
- Royal Lineages (2 tomes) track the bloodline — currently held by the Lionfish King

### Elves
- Born among human families blessed by an elder spirit in Okiri
- Connected to the Spirit Realm, bearing marks of power
- Births growing rarer over generations

### Dara
- Emerge from sacred trees in the forest of Roa Kala
- Flesh and blood, not spirits — though widely believed to be avatars of the island spirit
- Origin is a complete mystery, even to themselves
- Follow glyphs inscribed by the First Dara

## Themes & Tone

- **Leisure fantasy** — warm breezes, cozy campfires, hot ramen, small sensory details
- **Magic in the mundane** — innocence, laughter, simple joys alongside mystery and intrigue
- **Small stories** — focus on villages, quirky characters, subtle nuances
- **Roleplay over combat** — conversations can be as fulfilling as fights
- **Combat avoidable** — creativity, tact, magic can solve most problems. Danger increases going east.
- **Evil is rare** — most villains are comically ambitious, predictably greedy, or misguided. Dig deeper and they have reasons. True evil exists (corrupted demons) but is a "small pinch of spice."
- **No multiverse** — two planes only. No gods. Island reverence over deity worship.
