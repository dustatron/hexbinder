## Dynamic Dungeon State (Phase 5)

From `docs/dungeon-improvements-plan.md` - skipped due to complexity.

**Features:**
- Alert levels: normal → cautious → alarmed → lockdown
- Resource depletion forcing inhabitants to raid settlements
- Dungeon repopulation after extended player absence
- `lastVisited` timestamps
- Connection to faction clocks

**Why it's interesting:** Makes dungeons feel alive and reactive to player actions.

**Why it was skipped:** Breaks "same seed = same world" determinism, requires separate runtime state storage, architecturally complex.

**Implementation notes:** See Phase 5 in dungeon-improvements-plan.md for full spec.
