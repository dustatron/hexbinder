# Shadowdark RPG - Monster & Encounter Design

## Monster Statistics

### Core Monster Stats

**Level (LV)**: General power level, roughly equivalent to character level
**Hit Points (HP)**: How much damage before death
**Armor Class (AC)**: Target number to hit
**Attack**: Attack bonus and damage
**Move**: Movement category (near/far/special)
**Morale**: Modifier to morale checks (default WIS)

### Typical Stats by Level

| LV | HP | AC | Attack | Damage |
|----|----|----|--------|--------|
| 0 | 1-3 | 10 | +0 | 1d4 |
| 1 | 4-8 | 11-12 | +1 | 1d6 |
| 2 | 8-14 | 12-13 | +2 | 1d6+1 |
| 3 | 14-20 | 13-14 | +3 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 20-28 | 14-15 | +4 | 1d8+2 |
| 5 | 28-36 | 15-16 | +5 | 1d10 |
| 6+ | 36+ | 16+ | +6+ | 2d6+ |

### Special Abilities

Monsters become interesting through special abilities:
- **Resistances/Immunities**: Reduced or no damage from certain sources
- **Multiple Attacks**: More than one attack per round
- **Special Movement**: Flying, climbing, swimming, burrowing
- **Auras**: Ongoing effects in an area
- **Spellcasting**: Access to spells

## Building Encounters

### Encounter Difficulty

Rough guidelines for balancing:
- **Easy**: Total monster levels = half party levels
- **Medium**: Total monster levels = party levels
- **Hard**: Total monster levels = 1.5× party levels
- **Deadly**: Total monster levels = 2× party levels

**Example**: 4 level-3 characters (12 total levels)
- Easy: LV 6 worth of monsters
- Medium: LV 12 worth of monsters
- Hard: LV 18 worth of monsters
- Deadly: LV 24 worth of monsters

### Numbers vs. Power

Multiple weak enemies vs. fewer strong enemies:

**Many Weak (mob)**:
- More attacks, harder to deal with AOE
- Action economy advantage
- Morale breaks earlier
- Easier to kill individually

**Few Strong (boss)**:
- High damage, fewer attacks
- Harder to take down
- More dramatic
- Single point of failure

**Mixed Groups**:
- Boss + minions is classic
- Different threats require different tactics
- Creates interesting decisions

- High HP, medium-high damage

## Designing Memorable Monsters

### Give Them Personality

Even animals have behaviors:
- Territorial: Defend area, may let party retreat
- Hungry: Want food, might take offering
- Curious: Investigate before attacking
- Fearful: Attack if cornered, prefer to flee
- Malicious: Enjoys causing suffering

### Make Abilities Clear

Players should understand what monsters do:
- Visual cues for abilities
- Consistent behavior patterns
- Telegraphed big attacks
- Logical weaknesses

### Create Tactical Decisions

Good monster encounters require choices:
- "Do we focus the caster or the brute?"
- "Can we flee or are we cornered?"
- "Is negotiation possible?"
- "What's their weakness?"

2. **Minion waves**: Reinforcements during fight

## Encounter Environments

### Terrain Features

**Elevation**: High ground, pits, ledges
**Cover**: Pillars, walls, debris
**Difficult terrain**: Rubble, water, ice
**Hazards**: Traps, fire, acid
**Interactables**: Levers, chandeliers, bridges

### Using the Environment

Monsters should use terrain:
- Archers on high ground
- Ambushers behind cover
- Grapplers near cliffs
- Flyers above melee reach

Players should use terrain too:
- Bottleneck doorways
- Drop chandeliers
- Lure to traps
- Create cover

## Morale and Negotiation

### When to Check Morale

Check morale when:
- Half the group is killed/fled
- Leader is killed
- Situation dramatically worsens
- Unexpected threat appears

**DC 15 WIS check** - Failure = flee or surrender

### Beyond Combat

Not all encounters need violence:
- **Bribe**: Offer food, gold, items
- **Intimidate**: Show superior force
- **Negotiate**: Find mutual benefit
- **Deceive**: Trick them
- **Befriend**: Genuinely help

### Surrender Options

Intelligent enemies might:
- Offer information for lives
- Become prisoners (potential plot)
- Swear service (temporary ally)
- Feign surrender (ambush later)
