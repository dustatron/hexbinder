## Key Design Principles

1. **Roll only when it matters** — consequences, skill, time pressure
2. **Player skill over character builds** — clever play wins
3. **Light is life** — real-time torch tracking
4. **XP for treasure** — not for killing
5. **Rulings over rules** — GM adjudicates
6. **Death is real** — consequences matter
