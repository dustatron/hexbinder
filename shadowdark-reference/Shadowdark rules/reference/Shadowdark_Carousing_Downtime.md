# Shadowdark RPG - Carousing & Downtime

## The Carousing System

Carousing is how characters convert gold to XP between adventures. It represents spending money on revelry, making connections, and living the adventurer lifestyle.

### Why Carouse?

1. **XP for Gold**: 1 GP spent = 1 XP gained
2. **Narrative hooks**: Consequences create adventure seeds
3. **Character development**: What does your character do when not dungeon-crawling?
4. **Resource management**: Balances hoarding vs. advancement
