# Shadowdark RPG - Exploration & Travel

## Movement in Dungeons

### Distance Categories
| Category | Distance | In Combat |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Close | 5 feet | No movement needed |
| Near | Within 30 feet | One move action |
| Far | Beyond 30 feet | Multiple moves or ranged |

### Movement Actions

**Normal Movement**: Move to near distance as part of your turn

**Climbing**
- STR or DEX check
- Move at half speed while climbing
- Fall if you fail by 5 or more points
- Rope/ladder = easier (advantage) or no check

**Swimming**
- Move at half speed
- STR check in rough/turbulent water
- CON check each round holding breath
- Armor affects this (chainmail = disadvantage, plate = can't swim)

**Moving Through Creatures**
- Move freely through allies
- Move through enemies requires STR or DEX check
- Failure = can't pass, stuck in place

**Falling**
- 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen
- No save, but soft landing reduces damage (GM discretion)

**Rough Terrain**
- Move at half speed
- Examples: rubble, thick vegetation, shallow water, steep stairs

## Stealth and Hiding

### Going Undetected

**To Hide**:
- Make a DEX check
- Must have somewhere to hide (shadows, cover, etc.)
- Can't hide while creatures can see you

**Staying Hidden**:
- Maintain cover/concealment
- Don't make noise
- Don't draw attention

### Detecting Hidden Creatures

**Automatic Detection**:
- Looking in the right place automatically reveals hidden creatures
- "I search behind the statue" = find anyone hiding there

**Active Perception**:
- WIS check to notice sneaking/hiding creatures
- Only when not looking directly at their hiding spot

### Surprise

If one side is unaware of the other:
- Aware side gets a full round of actions
- Advantage on attacks against surprised targets
- After surprise round, roll initiative normally

## Dungeon Exploration Procedure

### The Exploration Loop

1. **Describe the environment** - What do they see/hear/smell?
2. **Players declare actions** - What are they doing?
3. **Resolve actions** - Searching, moving, interacting
4. **Check for encounters** - Roll if enough time has passed
5. **Track resources** - Time, light, rations
6. **Repeat**

### Searching

**Casual Observation**: Describe obvious features automatically

**Searching a Specific Area**: Automatically find anything there (traps, hidden items, secret doors)

**General Search of Room**: Takes time, may trigger encounter check

**No "Perception Checks" to Find Things**: Player says where they look, GM says what they find

### Opening Doors

- **Unlocked**: Just open it
- **Stuck**: STR check to force
- **Locked**: 
  - Thieves pick (DEX check if time pressure)
  - Break down (STR check, makes noise)
  - Find key elsewhere

### Listening

- Press ear to door
- WIS check to hear through door
- Success = GM describes sounds
- Failure = uncertain (might be quiet OR might have failed)

---

## Overland Travel

### Travel Pace

**Standard Day**: Up to 8 hours of travel

**Pushing Further**:
- Can travel additional hours
- Each extra hour = CON check
- DC increases each hour
- Failure = exhaustion effects

### Hex Crawl Basics

**Hex Size**: 6 miles across

**Travel Time**:
| Terrain | Hours per Hex |
|---------|---------------|
| Road | 2 hours |
| Clear | 3 hours |
| Forest/Hills | 4 hours |
| Mountains/Swamp | 6 hours |

### Navigation

**In Familiar Territory**: No check needed

**In Unfamiliar Territory**: INT check when exiting a hex
- Success: Move to intended hex
- Failure: Move to random adjacent hex
- Players may not know they're lost!

### Foraging

**Finding Food**: INT check
- Success: Find 1 ration
- Can attempt once per day while traveling
- Some terrains make this easier/harder

### Starvation

**Without Rations**:
- Can go 3 days without food
- After 3 days: 1 CON damage per day
- At 0 CON = death
- Water is similar but faster (1 day without = problems)

### Random Encounters (Overland)

| Danger Level | Check Frequency |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Unsafe | Every 3 hours |
| Risky | Every 2 hours |
| Deadly | Every 1 hour |

Roll d6: Encounter on a 1

## Light and Darkness

### The Core Tension

**Light is life** in Shadowdark. Managing light creates the game's signature tension.

### Light Sources

| Source | Range | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Torch | Near (30 ft) | 1 hour real time |
| Lantern | Near (30 ft) | 3 hours per oil |
| Candle | Close (5 ft) | 1 hour |
| Campfire | Near (30 ft) | 8 hours (attended) |

### Real-Time Tracking

Torches burn in **real time**:
- Start a timer when torch is lit
- 60 real minutes = torch dies
- Players must manage their own light
- Creates genuine urgency

### Darkness Effects

When in **total darkness**:
- Disadvantage on all sight-based checks
- Environment becomes **deadly** danger level
- Random encounter checks **every round**
- Can't read, can't see enemies clearly

### Darkvision

Some ancestries (like dwarves) have darkvision:
- Can see in complete darkness
- Does NOT help party members without it
- Useful for scouting but limited

### Light Tactics

**Conservation**:
- Only light torches when needed
- Snuff torches during rest
- Use lanterns for longer expeditions

**Emergency**:
- Keep backup light source
- Know where exits are
- Darkvision characters can guide others

**Campfire**:
- 3 torches = 8-hour campfire
- Someone must tend it
- Good for safe rest areas

## Hazards

### Environmental Hazards

**Movement Hazards**:
- Quicksand: DC 12 STR or sink further
- Ice: DC 12 DEX or fall prone
- Rushing water: DC 15 STR or swept away

**Damage Hazards**:
- Toxic spores: DC 12 CON or 1d6 poison
- Extreme temperatures: 1d6 per hour
- Acid: 2d6 per round of contact

**Debilitating Hazards**:
- Antimagic zone: Spells don't work
- Cursed areas: Specific penalties
- Exhausting areas: Disadvantage on checks

### Traps

**Finding Traps**:
- Searching the right spot = automatically find it
- No "roll to detect" - players must be specific

**Disabling Traps**:
- Thieves/tinkerers can disable
- Given time and tools = auto-success
- Time pressure = DEX/INT check
- Wrong approach = trigger trap

**Trap Design Principles**:
- Always have a tell/hint
- Avoidable with clever play
- Consequential but not instant death
- Interesting choices for players
