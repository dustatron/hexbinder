# Shadowdark RPG - GM Guide

## Core Philosophy

Shadowdark embraces **old-school** principles with **modern** streamlined rules:

1. **Rulings over rules** - GM adjudicates situations, not rulebooks
2. **Player skill matters** - Clever play beats character builds
3. **Danger is real** - Characters can and will die
4. **Exploration is key** - The dungeon itself is an adversary
5. **Light is life** - Resource management creates tension

---

## Running the Game

### The GM Turn

Every round (or whenever appropriate), the GM should:

1. **Torches & Timers** - Check light sources, track real time
2. **Random Encounters** - Roll if in dangerous area
3. **Movement** - Describe what players see/hear
4. **Monsters** - Run enemy actions
5. **Environmental Effects** - Ongoing hazards, changing conditions

### Real-Time Torches

This is THE signature Shadowdark mechanic:
- A torch lasts **1 real hour** of play
- When the torch goes out, it goes out
- Players must track their own light
- Creates genuine tension without bookkeeping

**Tips for running this:**
- Use a visible timer (phone, hourglass, etc.)
- Announce when torches are getting low
- Let darkness create dramatic moments
- Don't be afraid to let them run out

### Calling for Rolls

Only call for a roll when:
- There's a meaningful consequence for failure
- The task requires skill
- There's time pressure

**Don't roll for:**
- Tasks anyone could accomplish given time
- Impossible tasks (auto-fail)
- Guaranteed successes
- Tedious repeated actions

Example: Picking a lock
- With tools, time, and no enemies nearby = auto-success
- With enemies approaching = DEX check
- Without proper tools = disadvantage or impossible

## Encounter Design

### Encounter Distance

Roll d6 when an encounter occurs:

| Roll | Distance | Tactical Implications |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| 1 | Close (5 ft) | Immediate melee, no prep time |
| 2-4 | Near (30 ft) | One move to engage, brief reaction |
| 5-6 | Far (beyond 30 ft) | Time to prepare, ranged viable |

### Monster Activity (2d6)

What are they doing when encountered?

| Roll | Activity | GM Notes |
|------|----------|----------|
| 2-4 | Hunting | Alert, aggressive, looking for food |
| 5-6 | Eating | Distracted, may defend food |
| 7-8 | Building/nesting | Territorial, protecting home |
| 9-10 | Socializing/playing | Relaxed, might be approachable |
| 11 | Guarding | Alert, defensive, won't leave post |
| 12 | Sleeping | Unaware, easy surprise if quiet |

### Reaction Rolls (2d6 + CHA)

Not every encounter should be combat! Roll reactions:

| Roll | Attitude | How They Act |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 2-6 | Hostile | Attack immediately or demand tribute |
| 7-8 | Suspicious | Defensive, ask questions, threaten |
| 9 | Neutral | Wait to see what PCs do |
| 10-11 | Curious | Interested, might talk or trade |
| 12+ | Friendly | Helpful, might offer information/aid |

**CHA matters!** A charismatic character can shift encounters dramatically.

### Monster Morale

Enemies aren't suicidal. Check morale when:
- Reduced to half HP
- Half their group is killed/fled

**DC 15 WIS check** - Failure = they flee or surrender

Intelligent enemies might negotiate, beg, or offer information.

---

## Danger Levels

### Unsafe
- Random encounter check every **3 rounds** (dungeon)
- Random encounter check every **3 hours** (overland)
- Standard dungeon areas, traveled roads

### Risky
- Random encounter check every **2 rounds** (dungeon)
- Random encounter check every **2 hours** (overland)
- Monster lairs, wild territories

### Deadly
- Random encounter check **every round** (dungeon)
- Random encounter check **every hour** (overland)
- Boss areas, deep wilderness, or **total darkness**

**Total Darkness = Automatically Deadly**

---

## Dungeon Design

### Room Contents

Classic dungeon stocking:

| d6 | Contents |
|----|----------|
| 1-2 | Empty (but include interesting details) |
| 3 | Trap or hazard |
| 4 | Monster |
| 5 | Monster with treasure |
| 6 | Special (puzzle, NPC, unique feature) |

### Treasure Placement

50% of random encounters have treasure. For placed encounters:
- Guards protect valuables
- Hidden caches reward exploration
- Trapped treasure adds risk/reward
- Trade goods and art objects alongside coins

### XP for Gold

Remember: **1 GP = 1 XP** when returned to safety.

This encourages:
- Creative solutions over fighting
- Exploration to find treasure
- Risk/reward decisions
- Getting OUT of the dungeon, not just going deeper

### Environmental Storytelling

Empty rooms should tell stories:
- Old bloodstains - what happened here?
- Abandoned camp - who left and why?
- Strange symbols - magical? cultist? warning?
- Evidence of passage - tracks, disturbed dust

---

## Traps

### Design Philosophy

Traps should be:
- **Telegraphed** - Always have a hint or tell
- **Avoidable** - Clever players can bypass them
- **Consequential** - Real danger, not just flavor
- **Interesting** - Create choices, not gotchas

### Finding Traps

- **Searching a specific area** automatically reveals traps
- No "roll to find traps" - player must say where they look
- Reward thorough, paranoid play

### Disabling Traps

Thieves and characters with tinkering skill can disable traps:
- With time and reasonable method = **automatic success**
- Under time pressure = **stat check required**
- Wrong approach = trigger the trap

### Example Traps

**Pressure Plate Pit**
- Tell: Slightly different colored floor tile
- Trigger: Stepping on plate
- Effect: 10-foot pit opens, 1d6 falling damage
- Bypass: Jump over, probe with pole, weight down plate

**Poison Needle Lock**
- Tell: Tiny hole next to keyhole
- Trigger: Failed lockpick attempt
- Effect: 1d6 poison damage, DC 12 CON or disadvantage 1 hour
- Bypass: Plug the hole, use gloves, magical detection

**Tripwire Alarm**
- Tell: Thin wire at ankle height
- Trigger: Walking through doorway
- Effect: Bell rings, alerts nearby monsters
- Bypass: Step over, cut carefully, disable bell first

## Hazards

Hazards are environmental dangers, not traditional traps.

### Movement Hazards
- **Quicksand**: DC 12 STR to escape, sink further on failure
- **Slippery ice**: DC 12 DEX or fall prone
- **Rushing water**: DC 15 STR or swept away

### Damage Hazards
- **Toxic spores**: DC 12 CON or 1d6 poison damage
- **Acid pools**: 2d6 damage per round of contact
- **Extreme heat/cold**: 1d6 damage per hour of exposure

### Weakening Hazards
- **Antimagic zones**: Spells don't function
- **Strength-sapping vapors**: -2 STR while in area
- **Cursed ground**: Healing doesn't work

---

## Combat Pacing

### Keep It Moving

- Set 30-second turn timers if players deliberate too long
- Use theater of the mind for simple fights
- Break out maps only for complex tactical situations
- Narrate monster actions quickly and dramatically

### Make Combat Meaningful

Every fight should have:
- **Stakes**: What's at risk?
- **Choices**: Multiple approaches
- **Consequences**: Victory or defeat matters
- **Drama**: Describe the action vividly

### When to End Fights Early

- Morale breaks - enemies flee
- Negotiation succeeds - enemies surrender
- Objective achieved - no need to kill everything
- Party retreats - let them flee

---

## Death and Consequences

### Character Death

Character death is part of Shadowdark. When it happens:
- Let the moment land - it should feel significant
- Allow brief mourning/reaction
- Introduce new character quickly (backup ready)
- Consider having backup arrive logically (prisoner, other adventurer)

### Alternatives to Death

Sometimes use alternatives:
- Captured by enemies
- Left for dead but survived
- Rescued at the last moment
- Divine intervention (costs something)

But don't overuse these - death should remain real.

### Failed Expeditions

If the party must retreat:
- They lose access to remaining treasure
- Monsters may relocate or reinforce
- Information gathered is still valuable
- XP for gold already retrieved counts

---

## Running NPCs

### Quick NPC Creation

Roll or choose:
- **Motivation**: What do they want?
- **Quirk**: One memorable trait
- **Knowledge**: What do they know that's useful?

### NPC Reactions

Use reaction rolls for initial attitude, then let roleplay adjust from there.

### Recurring NPCs

Track NPCs the party interacts with:
- Update their situations based on time passing
- Let them remember past interactions
- Create rivals and allies organically

## Pacing the Session

### Session Structure

1. **Recap** (5 min) - What happened last time
2. **Town business** (10-15 min) - Shopping, rumors, carousing
3. **Travel/Approach** (10-15 min) - Getting to the dungeon
4. **Dungeon exploration** (2-3 hours) - The main event
5. **Wrap-up** (15 min) - Return to town, XP, cliffhanger

### Managing Table Time

- Keep descriptions punchy and evocative
- Delegate note-taking to players
- Use quick dice mechanics for routine tasks
- Know when to summarize vs. play out
