## Shopping Tips

1. Light source (torches minimum)
2. Rations (need for resting)
3. Rope (endless utility)
4. Flint & steel (light those torches)

### High-Value Purchases
- **Extra torches**: Light is life
- **Oil flasks**: Lanterns last longer, can be used as weapons
- **Iron spikes**: Spike doors, create anchors, test for traps
- **Mirror**: See around corners safely
- **Pole**: Poke suspicious things from a distance

### Money Management
- Keep some gold in reserve for emergencies
- Don't spend everything on gear - save for carousing XP
- Mithral armor is expensive but worth it for stealth characters
