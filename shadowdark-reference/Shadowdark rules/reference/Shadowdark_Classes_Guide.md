## Fighter

### Core Identity
The Fighter is the quintessential warrior - reliable, deadly, and hard to kill. They excel at sustained combat and can use any weapon or armor in the game.

### Stats
- **Hit Die**: d8 per level
- **Weapons**: All weapons
- **Armor**: All armor and shields

### Key Abilities

**Weapon Mastery**
Choose one type of weapon. You deal +1 damage and have +1 to hit with that weapon type. This stacks as you level.

**Hauler**
Add your CON modifier (if positive) to your gear slots. Fighters can carry more equipment.

**Grit**
Once per day when reduced to 0 HP, make a DC 15 CON check. Success = stay at 1 HP instead.

### Talent Table Highlights
- Extra attacks (crucial for damage scaling)
- Additional weapon masteries
- Stat boosts
- Choose any talent at level 12

### Playing a Fighter: Tips
1. **Weapon mastery choice matters** - Longsword/greatsword are solid. Longbow for ranged backup.
2. **Position as the front line** - Your d8 hit die and armor make you the best tank
3. **Multiple attacks scale hard** - At higher levels, fighters output massive damage
4. **Don't neglect DEX** - Initiative matters since it's rolled every round
5. **Carry extra torches** - You have the slots for it

### Fighter Builds

## Thief

### Core Identity
The Thief is the skill specialist - sneaky, cunning, and devastating when striking from the shadows. They're fragile but deal massive burst damage.

### Stats
- **Hit Die**: d4 per level
- **Weapons**: Varies (typically light weapons)
- **Armor**: Leather armor only

### Key Abilities

**Backstab**
When attacking from hiding or against a surprised/unaware enemy:

This is your primary damage source and it scales dramatically.

**Thievery**

- Disabling traps
- Picking pockets
- Disguise
- Deception

### Talent Table Highlights

- Additional thief skills
- Stat boosts (especially DEX)
- Luck-related abilities

### Playing a Thief: Tips
1. **Always seek advantage** - Backstab is your bread and butter
2. **Stay out of direct combat** - d4 hit die means you're fragile
3. **Scout ahead** - Your skills make you the ideal point person
4. **Manage light carefully** - You need darkness to hide
5. **Short sword or dagger** - Light weapons work with your DEX

### Thief Builds
- **Assassin**: Max DEX, focus backstab talents, patient striker
- **Scout**: Balanced DEX/INT, trapfinding focus, party enabler
- **Face**: High CHA for reaction rolls, social manipulation focus

## Wizard

### Core Identity
The Wizard is the arcane scholar - physically weak but wielding reality-bending magic. High risk, high reward.

### Stats
- **Hit Die**: d4 per level
- **Weapons**: Limited (dagger, staff typically)
- **Armor**: None!
- **Spellcasting**: INT-based arcane magic

### Key Abilities

**Arcane Magic**
- Start with 3 Tier 1 spells
- Roll d20 + INT vs 10 + Spell Tier
- Natural 1 = lose ALL spells until rest + Mishap!

**Learn Spells**
Can learn spells from scrolls and other wizards' spellbooks. This is unique to wizards.

**Magic Missile**
Many wizards learn Magic Missile - auto-hit damage that doesn't require a roll.

### Talent Table Highlights
- Additional spells known
- Improved casting abilities
- Stat boosts (especially INT)
- Magical resistances

### Playing a Wizard: Tips
1. **INT is your lifeline** - Every point matters for spell success
2. **Stay far back** - No armor + d4 HP = extremely fragile
3. **Magic Missile is reliable** - Auto-hit when you can't risk failure
4. **Lower tier spells first** - Warm up before casting your big guns
5. **Scrolls are insurance** - Keep scrolls for emergencies (failure doesn't lock your spells)

### Wizard Builds
- **Blaster**: Max INT, damage spells, stay at far range
- **Controller**: High INT, utility/control spells, battlefield manipulation
- **Generalist**: Diverse spell selection, prepare for anything

### The Mishap Risk
Wizards have the highest risk of any class:
- Natural 1 = ALL spells locked until rest
- Plus you roll on the Mishap table
- This can be catastrophic mid-dungeon

Mitigation strategies:
- Only cast when necessary
- Keep backup scrolls/wands
- Position safely
- Consider if the spell is worth the risk

## Party Composition

### Ideal 4-Person Party
- **Fighter**: Tank and sustained damage
- **Priest**: Healing, support, secondary melee
- **Thief**: Skills, scouting, burst damage
- **Wizard**: Utility, area damage, problem solving

### 3-Person Party Options
- Fighter/Priest/Thief (no arcane magic but very survivable)
- Fighter/Priest/Wizard (no trapfinding, less scouting)
- Fighter/Thief/Wizard (no healing - dangerous!)

### 2-Person Party
Very challenging. Recommended combinations:
- Fighter + Priest (most survivable)
- Fighter + Thief (skills + combat)

### Solo Play
Extremely difficult. Consider:
- Fighter (most survivable)
- Use hirelings to fill gaps
- Play very cautiously

## Multiclassing

Shadowdark does NOT have multiclassing by default. Each character is a single class.

However, some variant rules exist:
- Learning skills through downtime
- Magic items granting abilities
- Hybrid classes from supplements

The single-class design is intentional - it keeps classes distinct and valuable.
