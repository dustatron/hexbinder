# Shadowdark RPG - Spellcasting Guide

## How Spellcasting Works

Shadowdark uses a **roll-to-cast** system. Every spell requires a successful check - there's always a chance of failure.

### The Spellcasting Check
**d20 + spellcasting stat modifier vs Spell DC**

- **Wizards**: Use INT modifier
- **Priests**: Use WIS modifier
- **Spell DC**: 10 + Spell Tier

| Spell Tier | DC |
|------------|-----|
| Tier 1 | 11 |
| Tier 2 | 12 |
| Tier 3 | 13 |
| Tier 4 | 14 |
| Tier 5 | 15 |

## Spell Failure

When you **fail** a spellcasting check:
- The spell does not take effect
- You **cannot cast that spell again** until you complete a rest
- The spell slot is not "lost" - you simply can't attempt it again

This creates meaningful tension - do you cast your best spell early and risk losing it, or save it for when you really need it?

---

## Critical Success (Natural 20)

When you roll a natural 20 on your spellcasting check:
- The spell automatically succeeds
- **Double one numerical effect** of the spell

Examples:
- Fireball dealing 4d6 damage → 8d6 damage
- Cure Wounds healing 1d8 → 2d8
- Hold Person lasting 5 rounds → 10 rounds

---

## Critical Failure (Natural 1)

### Wizards
On a natural 1:
1. The spell fails
2. You **cannot cast any spells** until you complete a rest
3. Roll on the **Mishap Table** (pg. 46 in core book)

Mishaps can include wild magical effects, harming yourself, attracting unwanted attention, etc.

### Priests
On a natural 1:
1. The spell fails
2. You **cannot cast that specific spell** until you:
   - Make **penance** to your deity
   - Complete a rest

You can still cast your other spells!

## Spell Focus (Concentration)

Some spells require **focus** to maintain. These are ongoing effects.

### Maintaining Focus
- Spell stays active until the **start of your next turn**
- At the start of each turn, make another spellcasting check
- **Success**: Spell continues
- **Failure**: Spell ends (but you don't lose the spell - you can cast it again)

### Focus and Distraction
If you take damage while focusing:
- Immediately make a spellcasting check
- **Failure**: Spell ends immediately
- **Success**: Spell continues

### Focus Limitations
- You can only focus on **one spell at a time**
- Casting another focus spell ends the first one
- Non-focus spells can be cast while maintaining focus

## Spell Tiers and Learning

### Tier Access by Level
| Level | Highest Tier Available |
|-------|----------------------|
| 1-2 | Tier 1 |
| 3-4 | Tier 2 |
| 5-6 | Tier 3 |
| 7-8 | Tier 4 |
| 9-10 | Tier 5 |

### Starting Spells
- **Wizard**: Starts with 3 Tier 1 spells
- **Priest**: Starts with 2 Tier 1 spells + Turn Undead

### Learning New Spells

**Wizards**:
- Can learn spells from scrolls (scroll is consumed)
- Can learn from spellbooks of other wizards
- Can research new spells during downtime

**Priests**:
- Gain new spells through prayer and devotion
- Typically gain access to new spells at new tiers
- May receive specific spells through divine revelation

---

## Using Magic Items

### Scrolls
Anyone who can read can attempt to use a spell scroll.

**Scroll Check**: d20 + spellcasting stat vs DC (10 + Spell Tier)
- Non-casters use their highest mental stat (INT, WIS, or CHA)

**Success**: Spell activates, scroll is consumed
**Failure**: Scroll is consumed, spell doesn't work
**Natural 1**: Scroll consumed + Mishap!

Key points:
- Failing a scroll check does NOT affect your known spells
- Scrolls are one-time use regardless of success
- Great way for non-casters to get emergency magic

### Wands
Wands contain a specific spell and can be used multiple times.

**Wand Check**: Same as scrolls (d20 + stat vs 10 + Spell Tier)

**Success**: Spell activates
**Failure**: Wand stops working until you rest
**Natural 1**: Wand **breaks permanently** + Mishap!

Key points:
- Unlike scrolls, wands don't get consumed on a single failure
- But a natural 1 destroys the wand forever
- Wands are valuable - use them wisely

---

## Penance (Priests Only)

When a priest rolls a natural 1, they must make penance before casting that spell again.

### Penance Options
1. **Holy Quest**: Complete a task for your deity
2. **Ritualistic Atonement**: Perform prayers and ceremonies
3. **Material Sacrifice**: Donate wealth to the temple

### Sacrifice Costs by Tier
| Spell Tier | Sacrifice Cost |
|------------|---------------|
| Tier 1 | 5 gp |
| Tier 2 | 20 gp |
| Tier 3 | 40 gp |
| Tier 4 | 90 gp |
| Tier 5 | 150 gp |

**Important**: Inadequate penance makes the spell loss **permanent**! The deity must be satisfied.

## Tactical Spellcasting Advice

### Managing Spell Risk
1. **Save big spells for critical moments** - The higher the tier, the higher the DC
2. **Lead with lower-tier spells** - Less risk, still effective
3. **Consider scrolls for emergencies** - Failing a scroll doesn't lock out your spells
4. **Position matters** - Don't get hit while focusing

### Wizard vs Priest Considerations

**Wizards**:
- Natural 1 is devastating (lose ALL spells)
- Higher INT means better success rate
- More spell variety but higher risk
- Mishap table can be chaotic

**Priests**:
- Natural 1 only affects that one spell
- Must manage penance costs
- More forgiving failure mode
- Deity relationship matters

### When NOT to Cast
- If you've already failed a key spell, consider alternatives
- Low on HP? A failed focus spell from damage could waste it
- Multiple enemies? Maybe save the fireball for when you really need it

### Focus Spell Management
- Start focus spells at advantageous moments
- Stay behind cover or allies while focusing
- Have a backup plan if focus breaks
- Consider if ongoing effect is worth the concentration tax

## Common Spellcasting Mistakes

1. **Forgetting the tier in DC calculation** - DC 10 + tier, not just DC 10
2. **Casting after failure** - You can't cast a failed spell until rest!
3. **Ignoring mishap on scrolls** - Natural 1 on scroll = mishap
4. **Stacking focus spells** - Only one at a time
5. **Forgetting penance costs** - Priests need to actually pay
